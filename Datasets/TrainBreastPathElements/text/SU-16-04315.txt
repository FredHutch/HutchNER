GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Forga , Glenda , A. left axilla SLN # 1 " is a 3.5 cm possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue .   
The node is sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A4 .   
( MUA / ch ) B )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Forga , Glenda , left breast central lumpectomy . " 
Specimen type :   Lumpectomy , with two needle wires inserted in the inferior and lateral areas . 
Formalin time :   1530 , 02/18/2016 , 22 hours . 
Tissue obtained for tumor banking :   Yes ; tumor and normal . 
Weight :   203.9 g. Size :   7.5 SI x 11.5 ML x 6.2 AP cm , skin - 11.5 x 3.5 cm , nipple 1.2 cm . 
Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . 
Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 17 slices , slice 1 - 0.7 cm , and slice 17 - 0.6 cm .   
The remainder of the slices are 0.4 - 0.7 cm . 
Findings : Size :   Firm tan - white mass , 5.5 x 4.0 x 3.3 cm . 
The medial to lateral dimension ( 3.3 cm ) is based on cumulative slice thickness of involved slices ( 10 - 14 ) .   
Tumor involves the skin and nipple .   
Largest dimension of tumor ( 5.5 x 4.0 cm ) is based on slice 11 . 
Biopsy site :   Not identified grossly . 
Distance to margins :   0.3 cm from the anterior ( blue ) margin ( in slice 11 ) , extending to the skin , 2.0 cm from the posterior ( black ) margin ( in slice 11 ) , 1.5 cm from superior ( red ) margin ( in slice 12 ) , 2.5 cm from anterior ( green ) margin , and widely free of medial ( yellow ) and lateral ( orange ) margins . 
Submitted :   Representatively .
