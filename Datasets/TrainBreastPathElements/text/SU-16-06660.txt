Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IHC INTERPRETATION : 
Lack of staining of the neoplastic cells for E - cadherin supports the impression of lobular differentiation . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Gary , Kathleen Noland , sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue .   
A 1.5 cm lymph node is identified on cut surfaces .   
The lymph node has blue - stained cut surfaces .   
The lymph node is entirely submitted in cassette A1 .   
( SR / pwt ) B )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Gary , Kathleen Noland , sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.4 cm tan - yellow portion of fibrofatty tissue .   
There is an eccentric 1 cm blue - stained lymph node candidate .   
The lymph node candidate is entirely submitted in cassette B1 .   ( SR / pwt ) 
C )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Gary , Kathleen Noland , sentinel lymph node # 3 " is a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm blue - stained lymph node with a scant amount of attached adipose tissue .   
The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted in cassette C1 .   
( SR / pwt ) D )     Received fresh in a container labeled " Gary , Kathleen , left breast lumpectomy " is a 33 g , 5.0 SI x 4.5 ML x 4.5 AP wire - localized lumpectomy .   
The margins of resection are inked by the surgeon as follows : superior - red ; inferior - blue ; lateral - orange ; medial - yellow , anterior - green ; posterior - black .   
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral into six separate slices with slices 1 - 6 averaging 0.6 cm in thickness .   
In slices 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 is a fairly well circumscribed 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.9 cm tan , firm mass .   
The mass has an inserted metal clip and a biopsy site in slice # 3 .   
The mass is located 0.5 cm from the inferior margin , 0.3 cm from the black - inked deep margin , 0.5 cm from the orange - inked lateral margin , 1.0 cm from the medial yellow - inked margin , 0.6 cm from the green - inked anterior margin and is located 0.5 cm from the superior margin .   
Representative sections are submitted labeled : D1 - perpendicularly sectioned slice # 1 with inferior extent of mass D2 - mass from slice # 2 with inked lateral margin D3 - mass with closest approach to deep margin slice # 3 D4 - mass with closest approach to anterior margin slice # 3 D5 - mass to yellow - inked medial margin D6 - mass to orange - inked lateral and black - inked deep margins slice # 4 D7 - mass from slice # 5 with no inked margin superior extent of mass D8 - portion of slice # 6 normal breast tissue superior side of mass Total fixation time 17 hours . 
Comment :   The specimen was discussed with Dr. Garcia . 
( SR / kc ) E )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Gary , Kathleen Noland , left breast superior / medial margin " is a 2 g , 4.0 x 2.0 x 0.3 cm portion of fibrofatty breast tissue .   
One margin has been inked red by the surgeon .   
The specimen is serially sectioned and there are fatty cut surfaces and no masses or lesions are identified .   
The specimen is entirely submitted sequentially in three cassettes .
