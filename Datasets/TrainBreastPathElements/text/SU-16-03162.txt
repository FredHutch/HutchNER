ADDENDUM REASON : To report results of prognostic and predictive markers ADDENDUM IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDIES : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Invasive carcinoma Interpreted by :   Nicole K Andeen , MD and Suzanne Dintzis , MD , PhD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     SMHC     Smooth Muscle Myosin Heavy Chain [ SMMS-1 ]     
Absent around tumor nests Formalin - fixed , deparaffinized sections are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies . 
Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Invasive carcinoma Interpreted by :   Nicole K Andeen , MD and Suzanne Dintzis , MD , PhD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     100 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong . 
Allred 8 of 8 A1     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression ( 1 + ) A1     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     5 % positive cells A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     90 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong . 
Allred 8 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .
