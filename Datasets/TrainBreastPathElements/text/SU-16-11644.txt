GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Nunn , Lorna Mae , A. right axillary sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 1.3 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue , sectioned and entirely submitted in A1 . 
B )     Received in formalin labeled " Nunn , Lorna Mae , B. right axillary sentinel node # 2 " is a 0.6 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node with scant surrounding adipose tissue , trisected and entirely submitted in B1 . 
C )     Received in formalin labeled " Nunn , Lorna Mae , B. right axillary sentinel node # 2 " D )     Received in formalin labeled " Nunn , Lorna Mae , D. right axillary SLN # 4 " is a 0.4 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue , bisected and entirely submitted in D1 . 
E )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Nunn , Lorna Mae " and " right breast lumpectomy , short superior , long lateral " Specimen type :   Right breast lumpectomy Formalin time :   May 5 , 2016 at 7:30 a.m. Tissue obtained for tumor banking : No Weight :   11.0 g Size :   5.0 SI x 3.2 ML x 1.0 AP cm Oriented With :   Two stitches , short superior , long lateral and has been inked per protocol by the surgeon . 
Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . Sectioning :   Superior to inferior in 13 slices , each slice measures approximately 0.3 cm average thickness . 
Findings :    
An ill - defined area of tan - white to tan - yellow firm mass is identified in slices 4 , 5 , 6 surrounded by an area of tan - red hemorrhage , possible biopsy site , no clip identified . 
Lesion # 1 : 
Size : Approximately 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm . 
Distance to margins : Lies grossly 0.9 cm from the anterior margin , 0.3 from posterior , 0.3 from medial , 1.5 from lateral , 1.9 from superior and 1.0 cm from the inferior margin . 
Submitted : Entirely . 
Cassettes submitted : E1-E3 - perpendicular sections of inferior margin , submitted entirely ( slice 1 ) E4 - slice 2 E5 - slice 3 E6 - slice 4 E7 - slice 5 E8-E9 - slice 6 bisected E10-E11 - slice 7 bisected E12-E13 - slice 8 bisected E14 - slice 9 E15 - slice 10 E16 - slice 11 E17 - slice 12 E18-E19 - slice 13 ( superior margin perpendicularly sectioned and submitted entirely ) A photograph of the specimen was taken . 
( ABA / kc ) F )     Received in formalin labeled " Nunn , Lorna Mae , F. right breast medial inferior margin " is a 1.7 g , 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.0 cm breast reexcision specimen , previously inked yellow on one surface designating the new medial inferior margin .   
The opposite surface is uninked .   
It is sectioned from one end to the opposite into eight slices , numbered respectively .   
Slice 1 has an ill - defined 0.3 cm firm , white area that is at the inked margin .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 95% ) intermixed with thin , white fibrous tissue ( 5% ) .   
It is entirely submitted from slice 1 respectively ( F1 and F4 with slices 1 and 8 perpendicular ) .
