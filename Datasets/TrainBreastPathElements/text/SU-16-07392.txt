Microscopic examination was used to arrive at the diagnosis unless indicated otherwise . 
ADDENDUM REASON : To report results of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in - situ hybridization . MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION : A recut slide confirms residual invasive carcinoma in the block . 
DNA ANALYSIS : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Carcinoma cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Chromosome 17 PROBE     1.87 signals / cell A1     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Her2Neu PROBE     1.94 signals / cell Ratio : 1.0         Interpretation : NEGATIVE Unstained sections are prepared and regions of invasive carcinoma are marked by comparison with H&E - stained sections from the same block .   
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA - approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit .   
The prepared slides are then viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the chromosome 17 probe ( green ) , the Her-2/neu probe ( orange ) and DNA ( blue ) to localize nuclei .   
Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed .   
Control slides from non - amplified and low - level amplified tumor cells are prepared simultaneously to ensure reproducibility between assays .   
Results for this morphometric , multiplex assay are listed in the table above . 
Note : 
According to the 2013 ASCO / CAP Guideline Recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer ( J Clin Oncol 2013 ; 31 : 3997 - 4013 ) , ratios for HER2/CEP17 of less than 2.0 are interpreted as negative , ratios greater than or equal to 2.0 are interpreted as positive , and ratios less than 2.0 with an average HER2 signals / cell greater than or equal to 4.0 and less than 6.0 are interpreted as equivocal for gene amplification . 
Alternatively , cancers having single - probe average greater than or equal to 6.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted positive and less than 4.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted as negative .
