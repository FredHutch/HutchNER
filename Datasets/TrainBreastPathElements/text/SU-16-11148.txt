Oriented With :   inking scheme Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon : superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . Sectioning :   Superior to inferior in eight slices averaging 0.4 cm each with the first and last slice measuring 0.8 cm .
