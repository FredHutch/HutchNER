Changes consistent with previous biopsy site :     
Present Final surgical resection margins ( including separately submitted margins ) : Invasive carcinoma margins :     Invasive carcinoma > = 0.5 cm from all margins DCIS margin :     DCIS > = 0.5 cm from all margins Lymph node involvement Sentinel nodes :     Sentinel nodes with carcinoma 0     / Total sentinel nodes 4 Non - sentinel nodes :     Non - sentinel nodes with carcinoma : 0     / Total non - sentinel nodes : 0 - Total number of nodes with macrometastases :     0 - Total number of nodes with micrometastases :     0 - Total number of nodes with isolated tumor cells :     0 Minimum pathologic stage ( AJCC , 7th ed . , 2010 ) TNM descriptors :     none Primary tumor [ pT ] :     pT1c : Tumor > 1.0 cm and < = 2.0 cm - greatest dimension Regional nodes [ pN ] :     pN0 : No regional lymph node metastasis histologically ( ITCs may be present ) N stage modifier :     ( sn ) : Only sentinel node(s ) evaluated . 
Comment about stage assignment : Size ( 1.1 cm ) of neoplasm from previous biopsy ( SU-16 - 4583 ) used for final stage assessment . 
COMMENT : The implant was received as part of the mastectomy specimen and located directly behind breast parenchyma that contains both the invasive and in situ component of the carcinoma .   
Additionally , behind the implant / capsule are portions of residual tissue .   
The breast parenchyma surrounding the breast implant / capsule is inked green ( and not a true margin ) and the presumed true posterior margin is inked black .   
The neoplasm ( both in - situ and invasive ) is > 0.5 cm from all true margins .

Formalin - fixed , deparaffinized sections are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies . 
Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IHC COMMENT : The interpretation of DCIS and invasive carcinoma are supported by appropriate P63 and alphaSmooth Muscle Actin immunoreactivity .
