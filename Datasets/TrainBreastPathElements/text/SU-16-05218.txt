( Melissa Upton , M.D./N. Reder , M.D. )   ( MUA / pwt ) CLINICAL DATA : Part D is collected 02/29/16 and placed in formalin at 6:30 p.m.   Total fixation time is approximately 18 hours . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh labeled " Pecoraro , Charlene Joyce , A. left axilla sentinel node # 1 " is a 1.5 x 1 x 0.5 cm possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The node is sectioned and entirely submitted in A1 .   
( MUA / pwt ) B )     Received fresh labeled " Pecoraro , Charlene Joyce , B. left axilla lymph node # 2 " are two possible lymph nodes with surrounding adipose tissue , 0.4 and 0.6 cm .   
The smaller node is inked .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The nodes are sectioned and entirely submitted in B1 .   
( MUA / pwt ) C )     Received fresh labeled " Pecoraro , Charlene Joyce , C. left axilla lymph node # 3 " is a 0.5 cm blue - dyed   possible lymph node with extensive amount of surrounding adipose tissue .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The node is bisected and entirely submitted in C1 .   
( MUA / pwt ) D )     Received fresh labeled " Pecoraro , Charlene Joyce , D. left breast lumpectomy " is a 29 g breast excision with a short stitch designating superior and a long stitch designating lateral .   
It is 7.0 cm medial to lateral x 5.4 cm superior to inferior x 1.9 cm anterior to posterior .   
It is previously inked : superior - red , inferior - blue , lateral - orange , medial - yellow , anterior - green , posterior - black .   
The tissue is sectioned into nine slices , numbered respectively from lateral to medial .   
In slices 5 and 6 is an ill - defined 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm firm white mass ( coil biopsy clip identified in slice 6 ) .   
The mass is at the anterior margin , 1.5 cm from the posterior margin , 1.3 cm from the superior margin , 2.0 cm from the inferior margin and widely free of the medial and lateral margins .   
No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 90% ) intermixed with thin white fibrous tissue ( 10% ) .   
The tissue is entirely submitted : D1 - slice 1 , perpendicular D2-D3 - composite slice 2 D4-D6 - composite slice 3 D7-D9 - composite slice 4 ( tissue adjacent to mass ) D10-D11 - composite slice 5 with mass D12-D14 - composite slice 6 with mass D15-D17 - composite slice 7 D18-D19 - composite slice 8 D20-D21 - composite slice 9 , perpendicular The tissue is entirely submitted and a photograph is taken .
