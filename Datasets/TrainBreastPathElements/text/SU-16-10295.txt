GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh in a container labeled " Larkin , Diane , right breast " and is a 153 g , 15 cm ML x 14.5 cm SI x 3.5 cm AP simple mastectomy specimen .   
This includes an 11.5 x 4.6 cm ellipse of skin and a 1 x 1 x 0.8 cm nipple .   
No skin changes are evident on the skin and nipple .   
The specimen is inked as follows :   superficial superior margin - orange , superficial inferior margin - blue , posterior / deep margin - black .   
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral in approximately 0.5 cm intervals and allowed to fix overnight for a total of 24.2 hours .   
After fixation , no mass lesions are identified .   
However , a surgical clip and a scant amount of white fibrous / possible scar tissue are identified in the 12:30 position .   
There is associated rubbery white fibroglandular tissue with focal fat necrosis .   
Separately , there is a small area of calcification at the 9:00 position .   
This calcification is confined to a single slice and has a greatest dimension of 0.4 cm .   
The breast is approximately 60% lobular adipose tissue .   
No lymph nodes are identified .   
Sections are submitted as follows : A1 - nipple section A2 - medial bracketing slice of area with surgical clip A3 - section of slice with surgical clip and surrounding possible fibrosis A4 - lateral bracketing slice of surgical clip site A5 - area of calcification A6 - random upper outer quadrant A7 - random lower outer quadrant A8 - random upper inner quadrant A9 - random lower inner quadrant ( JL / pwt ) B )     Received in a container labelled " Larkin , Diane , left breast " is a 175 g , 13.5 cm ML x 13.5 cm SI x 3 cm AP mastectomy specimen oriented with a short stitch at the superior aspect and a long stitch at the lateral aspect .   
There is a 13 x 6 cm ellipse of skin with a 1 x 1 x 0.9 cm nipple ; neither skin nor nipple has gross pathologic changes .   
The margins are inked as follows :   superior superficial - orange , inferior superficial - blue , posterior / deep - black .   
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral in approximately 0.5 cm sections and allowed to fix overnight for a total of 24 hours of fixation time .   
After fixation , a biopsy site is identified in approximately the 5:00 position at mid to anterior depth .   
This is approximately 0.5 cm from both the anterior and posterior margins and is involved by firm , fibrotic tissue spanning 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm .   
A single calcification is identified in the 3:00 position approximately 2.5 cm superior to the biopsy clip .   
No other lesions or calcifications or fibrous scars are identified .   
No lymph nodes are identified in the parenchyma .   
The breast specimen is approximately 60% lobular adipose tissue and the remainder is firm , rubbery , tan - white fibroglandular tissue .   
One small cyst measuring 0.8 cm in greatest dimension is identified 1 cm immediately posterior to the nipple .   
This is associated with blue tracer dye .   
Representative sections are submitted as follows : B1 - nipple section B2 - cyst posterior to nipple B3 - lateral bracketing slice of biopsy site B4-B6 - serial sections through biopsy site B7 - medial bracketing slice of biopsy site B8 - isolated possible calcification B9 - random upper outer quadrant B10 - random lower outer quadrant B11 - random upper inner quadrant , fibroglandular tissue B12 - random lower inner quadrant JL / pwt ) C )     Received in formalin labeled " Larkin , Diane L. ; C. left axillary SLN # 1 " is a 0.6 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue trisected and entirely submitted in C1 .
