C50.911 GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Weholt , Susan , A. right breast medial margin " is a 9 g , 4.0 x 4.0 x 1.7 cm breast re - excision specimen with a loosely attached overlying 4.0 x 1.0 cm skin ellipse .   
The ellipse has a partially healed 3.0 cm linear scar .   
One surface of the soft tissue was previously inked yellow , designating new medial margin .   
The uninked surface has a thin fibrous lining ( possible previously biopsy site ) that is approximately 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.0 cm .   
The tissue surrounding the cavity is mildly firm , yellow , and lobulated adipose tissue admixed with thin fibrous stroma .   
The adipose tissue has slight bright yellow streaking ( possible fat necrosis ) .   
No discrete mass is identified .   
The tissue is sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A9 ( opposing ends in A1 ) .   
( MUA / ch ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Weholt , Susan , B. right breast superior margin " is a 5.2 g , 3.3 x 3.2 x 1.6 cm breast re - excision specimen , previously inked red on one surface and designating the new superior margin .   
The surface opposite the new superior margin has a thin membranous lining ( presumed previously biopsy site ) .   
The cut surface is yellow lobulated adipose tissue intermixed with thin fibrous stroma .   
There is mild fibrosis and possible fat necrosis surrounding the previous biopsy site .   
No discrete mass is identified .   
The tissue is sectioned and entirely submitted in cassettes B1-B7 ( opposing ends in B1 ) .   
( MUA / ch ) C )     Received in formalin labeled " Weholt , Susan , C. right breast lateral margin " is a 5.1 g , 3.3 x 2.7 x 1.3 cm breast re - excision specimen previously inked orange on one surface designating new lateral margin .   
The surface opposite the inked margin is lined with thin fibrous tissue ( presumed previous biopsy site ) .   
The cut surface is yellow lobulated adipose tissue intermixed with a thin white fibrous stroma .   
There is scattered mild bright yellow streaking of possible fat necrosis .   
No discrete mass is identified .   
The tissue is entirely submitted in cassettes C1-C4 ( opposing ends in C1 ) .
