Formalin - fixed , deparaffinized sections are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies . 
Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh labeled " Vickrey , Svetlana A. , A. left axillary lymph node # 1 " is a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm possible lymph node with a small amount of surrounding adipose tissue .   
Touch preparations are performed , bisected and entirely submitted in A1 . 
B )     Received fresh labeled " Vickrey , Svetlana A. , B. left axillary lymph node # 2 " is a 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm possible lymph node .   
Touch preparations are performed , bisected and entirely submitted in B1 . 
C )     Received fresh labeled " Vickrey , Svetlana A. , C. left axillary lymph node # 3 " is a 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.6 cm possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue .   
Touch preparations are performed , bisected , and entirely submitted in C1 . 
D )     Received fresh labeled " Vickrey , Svetlana A ; , D. left axillary lymph node # 4 " is a 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm possible lymph node .   
Touch preparations are performed , bisected , entirely submitted in D1 .   
( MUA / kc ) E )     Received in a container fresh and subsequently placed in formalin labeled " Vickrey , Svetlana " designated as " left breast , short superior , long lateral " and consists of a modified radical mastectomy specimen of the left breast .   
The specimen is oriented as follows :   short superior , long lateral .   
The specimen weighs 227 g , measures 15.0 x 14.0 x 2.0 cm with an overlying tan ellipse of skin measuring 17.5 x 6.0 cm . 
The overlying nipple is tan - white to tan , measures 0.9 x 0.8 cm .   
The surrounding areola is tan and measures 2.7 x 2.5 cm and grossly unremarkable .   
The specimen has been inked as follows : posterior - black ; anterior superior - orange , anterior inferior - blue .   
The specimen has been sectioned into thin slices approximately 0.3 x 0.4 cm from medial to lateral .   
The specimen was placed in formalin at approximately 10:00 a.m. on 05/03/2016 .   
Sectioning from medial to lateral reveals poorly circumscribed tan - white to tan - yellow firm mass lying at the 5:00 position in the lower outer quadrant measuring approximately 2.0 x 1.8 x 1.3 cm , with a biopsy clip . 
The mass lies approximately 4.0 cm from the nipple and lies 0.6 cm from the posterior margin inked black , 1.5 cm from the anterior skin , 2.0 cm from the superior anterior margin inked orange and 1.0 cm from the inferior anterior margin inked blue .   
The mass is surrounded by an area of tan - white fibrous tissue .   
In the 2:00 position , a diffuse area of tan - white fibrous tissue is present .   
No other gross lesions are identified .   
Surrounding breast tissue is comprised of approximately 60% tan - yellow lobular adipose tissue and remaining tan - white fibrous tissue . 
E1-E2 - composite section of mass to closest skin and posterior margin E3-E5 - cross section of mass to posterior and anterior inferior margin E6 - mass to closest superior anterior margin E7-E8 - adjacent fibrous tissue at 2:00 position E9 - tissue medial to the mass , grossly uninvolved E10 - tissue lateral to the mass , grossly uninvolved E11 - cross section of nipple E12 - representative section , left upper inner quadrant E13 - representative section , lower inner quadrant E14 - representative section , upper outer quadrant approximately 2:00 position ( AB / kc ) Anshu   Bandhlish MD Fellow 05/05/2016 Suzanne   Dintzis MD , PhD Pathologist Electronically signed
