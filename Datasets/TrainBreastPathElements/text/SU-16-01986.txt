Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . 
Sectioning :   Superior to inferior in nine sections of 0.4 cm average thickness . 
Findings : Lesion # 1 :   Stellate white , fibrous lesion involving slices 4 - 7 .   
Nearby nodularity prominent in slice # 8 . 
There is a small , nearby mass ( 0.5 cm away , slice 7 ) measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension .   
The small nodularity in slice # 7 is 0.4 cm from the posterior margin . 
Size : 1.2 x 0.9 x 1.2 cm Biopsy site :     Needle insertion site indentified in center of lesion # 1 . 
Distance to margins : 1.2 cm to anterior , 1.5 to medial , 1.5 cm to lateral , 1.3 cm to posterior , 1.2 cm to superior , 1.5 cm to inferior . 
Relationship to other structures :   The small nodularity in slice # 7 is 0.4 cm from the posterior margin . Submitted : Entirely . 
Cassettes submitted :   Representative sections constituting 90% of the total tissue are submitted as follows : A1 , A2 - alternating perpendicular sections through slice # 1 ( superior margin ) A3 - lateral margin in slice # 2 A4 - posterolateral of slice 3 A5 - anterolateral of slice 3 A6-A9 - composite section of slice 4 , entirely submitted A10-A13 - composite section of slice 5 A14-A17 - composite section of slice 6 A18-A21 - composite section of slice 7 A22-A25 - slice # 8 , composite section A26 - 28 - slice # 9 ( inferior margin ) entirely submitted The specimen was reviewed with Melissa Ardales , P.A. ( PDS / kc ) B )     Received fresh in a container labeled " McDougall , Cindy Lee " designated " B. , right axillary lymph nodes level I and II " and consists of a 79 g , 9.0 x 6.5 x 2.5 cm fatty tissue specimen .
