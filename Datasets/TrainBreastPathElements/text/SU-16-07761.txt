COMMENT : H&E - stained sections reveal needle core biopsies of lymph node parenchyma largely effaced by carcinoma morphologically consistent with a breast primary .   
There is one focus suspicious ( but indefinite ) for extracapsular extension .   
Additionally , there is uninvolved breast parenchyma and fibrovascular adipose tissue that appears to have in - situ neoplasm ( DCIS ) , but may represent a contaminant .   
Regardless , there is metastasis to the sampled lymph node . _
