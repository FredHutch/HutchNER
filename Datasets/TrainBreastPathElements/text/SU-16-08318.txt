Ductal carcinoma in situ with the following features : a. Low to intermediate nuclear grade . 
b. Present at 12 - 12:30 spanning 0.7 cm ( as measured on slide ) .   
See comment . c. Microcalcifications present in association with florid usual ductal hyperplasia but negative in DCIS . 
d. Skin and nipple with no neoplasm identified . 
e. No invasive carcinoma identified . 
f. Sampled margins are negative for DCIS ( > 0.5 cm ) . 
g. Biopsy site changes present at 5 - 7 o'clock and 12 - 12:30 o'clock . 2 . 
Background breast parenchyma has extensive fibrocystic proliferative changes including dense stromal fibrosis , microcysts , columnar cell change , intraductal papillary proliferations , and florid usual ductal hyperplasia . 3 . 
Atypical lobular hyperplasia and lobular carcinoma in - situ present . 
B - H ) Left axillary sentinel lymph nodes # 1-#7 , excisions : 7 lymph nodes ( 1 in each part ) with no neoplasm identified . 
COMMENT : This left breast mastectomy specimen contains extensive fibrocystic proliferative changes that span from the 5 - 7:00 o'clock region to the 12 - 12 - 30 o'clock region .   
At the 12 - 12 - 30 o'clock site , there is a 0.7 cm focus of low - intermediate grade DCIS present in association with biopsy site changes .   
The 5 - 7:00 o'clock region has florid usual ductal hyperplasia , papillary proliferations , and atypical ductal hyperplasia associated with biopsy site changes , but definitive findings of residual DCIS are not identified at that site .   
The patient 's previous biopsies ( SU-16 - 4387 and SU-16 - 6893 ) are re - reviewed with the current mastectomy specimen and the findings correlate . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CLINICAL DATA : Left breast DCIS .
