THIS IS AN ADDENDUM REPORT   * * * * Revision # 1 ( See end of report for new text ) : IHC / IF Results Revision # 2 ( See end of report for new text ) : FISH / PCR Results _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ FINAL DIAGNOSIS : A ) Left breast , mastectomy : * Multifocal invasive ductal carcinoma ( 3 separate foci ) ; please see comment and Summary Cancer Data below . 
B ) Left axillary lymph nodes , dissection : * 1 of 27 lymph nodes positive for carcinoma ( 1.5 cm ) with focal extracapsular extension with associated biopsy site changes . 
C ) Left breast implant , removal : * Medical device , consistent with breast prosthesis ( gross diagnosis only ) . 
D ) Additional left breast skin , excision * Skin and subcutaneous tissue with no neoplasm identified COMMENT : Lesions # 1 and # 2 ( 5:00 , 6 cm from nipple and 4:00 , 4.5 cm from nipple , respectively ) and morphologically similar with the same grade ( Nottingham III ) .   
Lesion # 3 ( 3:00 , 3.0 cm from nipple ) has somewhat different morphology and is overall Nottingham grade II .   
Therefore , it is favored that given the same morphology and close proximity to one another , lesions # 1 and # 2 are likely representative of the same primary , and that lesion # 3 is a separate primary . 
This is further supported by the absence of neoplasm in intervening breast parenchyma between masses .   
However , given the documented metastasis to the lymph node , it is quite possible that all three lesions are representative of the same primary with direct extension and/or deposits along lymphatics .   
The largest contiguous focus ( lesion # 2 ) is 1.3 cm and will be used for staging purposes below ; however , if all 3 lesions were considered 1 contiguous process , the overall span would be an estimated 6.3 cm which would change the stage from a pT1N1a to a pT3N1a .     
Lesions # 1 and # 2 are previously reported as positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression ( Allred scores 8 and 8 of 8) and negative for HER2 protein overexpression by IHC , Ki-67 15 - 25% .   
Prognostic markers can be performed on lesion # 3 or the lymph node metastasis upon request if clinically indicated .

Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A15 Population : Carcinoma from Lesion # 3 in part A Interpreted by :   Colin P NewBill , MD and Mark R Kilgore , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A15     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     > 95 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred score 8 of 8 A15     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression ( 0 - 1 + ) A15     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     15 % positive cells A15     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     > 95 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred score 8 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

ADDENDUM REASON : To report results of HER2 gene amplification by fluorescence in - situ hybridization . MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION : A recut slide confirms residual invasive carcinoma in the block . 
DNA ANALYSIS : Source ( Original Label ) : B5 Population : Carcinoma cells in lymph node metastasis Interpreted by :   Colin NewBill , MD and Suzanne Dintzis , MD , PhD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments B5     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Her2Neu PROBE     1.96 signals / cell B5     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Chromosome 17 PROBE     1.69 signals / cell Ratio : 1.2         Interpretation : NEGATIVE for gene amplification Unstained sections are prepared and regions of invasive carcinoma are marked by comparison with H&E - stained sections from the same block .   
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA - approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit .   
The prepared slides are then viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the chromosome 17 probe ( green ) , the Her-2/neu probe ( orange ) and DNA ( blue ) to localize nuclei .   
Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed .   
Control slides from non - amplified and low - level amplified tumor cells are prepared simultaneously to ensure reproducibility between assays .   
Results for this morphometric , multiplex assay are listed in the table above . 
Note : 
According to the 2013 ASCO / CAP Guideline Recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer ( J Clin Oncol 2013 ; 31 : 3997 - 4013 ) , ratios for HER2/CEP17 of less than 2.0 are interpreted as negative , ratios greater than or equal to 2.0 are interpreted as positive , and ratios less than 2.0 with an average HER2 signals / cell greater than or equal to 4.0 and less than 6.0 are interpreted as equivocal for gene amplification . 
Alternatively , cancers having single - probe average greater than or equal to 6.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted positive and less than 4.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted as negative .
