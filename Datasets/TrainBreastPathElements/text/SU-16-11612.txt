GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Stanton , Julia " and " right breast lumpectomy , short superior , long lateral . " 
Specimen type :   Lumpectomy with two localizing wires , one wire passing from superior to inferior and the other passing posteriorly . 
Formalin time :   Placed in formalin at 6:30 p.m. on 05/04/2016 . 
Tissue obtained for tumor banking : No . 
Weight :   13.0 
g Size :   Anterior to posterior 1.5 , superior to inferior 3.5 , medial to lateral 4.3 Oriented :   Short superior , long lateral and has been inked per protocol . 
Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . 
Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in a total of eight slices ; each slice measures approximately 0.4 cm average thickness . 
Findings :   Two lesions are identified , both with clips . 
Lesion # 1 : Identified in slice 5 with a dumbbell shaped clip .   
The lesion is ill - defined , tan - white to tan - yellow and firm with surrounding area of fibrosis . 
Size : Measures roughly approximately 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm .   
Present in slices 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 . 
Biopsy site :   < grossly identified or not , describe location if seen > Distance to margins : Lesion 1 lies approximately 0.7 from medial margin , 0.2 cm from lateral margin , 1.0 cm from superior margin , 0.2 cm from inferior margin , 0.2 cm from anterior margin and abuts the posterior margin . 
Lesion # 2 :   Identified in slice 8 with a clip that is rectangular , at the lateral margin which has been inked yellow surrounded by an ill - defined area of fibrosis . 
Size :   The second lesion measures approximately 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm .   
The lesion 2 lies approximately 0.3 cm from lesion 1 and the relationship to the other margins are lesion 2 abuts the lateral margin inked orange , lies 0.4 cm from the anterior margin inked green , abuts the posterior margin inked black and is widely free of the remaining margins ( superior , inferior , medial ) . 
Cassettes submitted : A1-A2 - medial margin perpendicular sections entirely submitted A3 - slice 2 representative sections A4 - slice 3 representative section A5-A6 - slice 4 , composite section A7-A8 - slice 5 composite section ( slice 8 with clip ) A9-A10 - slice 6 bisected A11-A12 - slice 7 bisected A13-A15 - slice 8 perpendicular sections of lateral margin ( clip in A14 ) 
A photo of the specimen was taken . 
( ABA / kc ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Stanton , Julia , B. right breast posterior margin " is a 4.1 g , 2.8 x 2.8 x 1.1 cm breast reexcision specimen previously inked black on one surface designating new posterior margin .   
The opposite surface is uninked .   
It is sectioned from one end to the opposite into eight slices , numbered respectively .   
Slices 2 and 3 is an ill - defined peripheral firm area , 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm .   
The firm area is at the new posterior margin .   
No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 90% ) intermixed with thin white fibrous tissue ( 10% ) .   
It is sectioned and entirely submitted from one end to the opposite in B1-B5 ( firm area in B2 ) .
