GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh in a container labeled " Turner , Laura Katherine " , and " right breast and level I and II nodes , short stitch superior , long lateral " . 
Specimen type :   Modified radical mastectomy Formalin time :   7:45 a.m. 4/7/2016 Tissue obtained for tumor banking :   No Weight :   229 g Overall size :   26 x 11.8 x 2.0 cm .   
The breast measures 13 cm medial to lateral , 12 cm inferior to superior , and 2 cm anterior to posterior . 
The attached axillary tail measures 12.5 x 5.5 x 0.8 cm . 
Skin : The attached portion of skin is tan and grossly unremarkable measuring 12.3 x 7.5 cm , with an areola measuring 2.5 cm , and a nipple measuring 1.0 x 0.8 cm . 
Inked per protocol :   Deep = black , superior superficial = orange , inferior superficial = blue . 
Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 12 slices of approximately 0.6 cm average thickness . 
Findings : Lesion # 1 : At approximately 5:30 , 4 cm from the nipple is a tan firm irregular mass measuring 1.8 x 1.8 x 1.2 cm located < 0.1 cm from the nearest posterior margin , 1.5 cm from the nearest anterior inferior margin , and 2.2 cm from the nearest anterior superior margin . 
A metallic clip is identified . 
Lesion # 2 :   There is a tan irregular area located at approximately 6:00 , 5 cm from the nipple measuring 1.2 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm located 0.2 cm from the nearest posterior margin , 3.0 cm from the nearest inferior anterior margin , and 4.5 cm from the nearest superior anterior margin .   
This lesion is located 0.8 cm from lesion # 1 and appears to involve the dermis . 
Background breast : The remainder of the breast is partially fibrotic with approximately 60% unremarkable yellow lobulated tissue with intervening white fibrous bands . 
Axillary tail : The axillary tail is sectioned to reveal 14 potential lymph nodes ranging in greatest dimension from 0.3 to 1.5 cm Cassette key : Lesion # 1 :       A1-A7 , lesion # 1 in entirety from lateral to medial , A7 contains area by clip A8 - nearest anterior inferior margin A9 - nearest anterior superior margin A10 - tissue between lesion 1 and lesion 2 , including edges of both lesions Lesion # 2 :     A11-A20 - lesion # 2 in entirety from medial to lateral , including entire posterior margin , A17-A18 and A19-A20 contain composite sections and include skin A17 and A19 contain nearest anterior inferior margin A21 - nearest anterior superior margin A22 - upper inner quadrant A23 - lower inner quadrant A24 - lower outer quadrant A25 - upper outer quadrant A26 - nipple Axillary tail lymph nodes are submitted as follows : A27 - one sectioned lymph node A28 - three potential lymph nodes A29 - four potential lymph nodes A30 - six potential lymph nodes ( SM / pwt ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Turner , Laura , B. additional level I lymph nodes " is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 1.3 cm portion of lobular fatty tissue and lymphoid .   
There is a solitary 1.4 x 1.2 x 1 cm lymph node candidate identified that is trisected and submitted entirely in B1 .
