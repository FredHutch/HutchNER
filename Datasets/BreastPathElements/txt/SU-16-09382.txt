Total fixation time :   Approximately 24.5 hours . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Fuller , Katherine Louise , right axillary sentinel node # 1 " is a 1.2 cm lightly blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue , sectioned and entirely submitted in A1 . 
B )     Received in formalin labeled " Fuller , Katherine Louise , B. right axillary sentinel node # 2 " is a 0.6 cm lightly blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue , trisected and entirely submitted in B1 .   
( MUA / kc ) C )     Received fresh labeled " Fuller , Katherine Louise , C. right partial mastectomy " is an oriented portion of fibrofatty tissue with a needle localization wire entering anteriorly and exiting medial .   
It is 25 g , 5.6 medial to lateral x 4.5 cm superior to inferior x 2.3 cm anterior to posterior .   
A 2.0 x 0.4 cm skin ellipse overlies the anterior surface .   
It is received previously inked as follows :   anterior green , inferior blue , lateral orange , medial yellow , posterior black , superior red .   
It is sectioned into eight slices , numbered respectively from medial to lateral .   
Slices 1 and 8 are approximately 0.8 cm and the remaining slices are 0.4 - 0.5 cm thick .   
A 2.4 x 1.3 x 1.3 cm ill - defined tan stellate mass is in slices 2 - 6 and has a central biopsy site filled with gelatinous material .   
A coiled clip is within the biopsy site .   
The mass is 0.7 cm from the superior margin , 0.6 cm from the posterior margin , 0.7 cm deep to the skin , 0.5 cm from the inferior margin , 0.8 cm from the medial margin , and 1.3 cm from the lateral margin .   
No other discrete masses or lesions are identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow lobulated adipose tissue ( 75% ) intermixed with dense white fibrous tissue ( 25% ) .   
The tissue is entirely submitted as follows : C1-C2 - composite slice 1 ( perpendicular ) C3-C4 - composite slice 2 C5-C6 - composite slice 3 C7-C9 - composite slice 4 C10-C12 - composite slice 5 C13-C15 - composite slice 6 C16-C17 - composite slice 7 C18-C19 - composite slice 8 ( perpendicular ) The tissue is entirely submitted .
