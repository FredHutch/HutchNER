IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDIES : Source ( Original Label ) : H6 
Population : Carcinoma cells Interpreted by :   Nicholas Reder , MD , MPH and Rochelle L Garcia , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments H6     E.CADHERIN     E - Cadherin [ EC - C ]     No loss of expression Formalin - fixed , deparaffinized sections are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies . 
Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IHC INTERPRETATION : Retained expression of E - cadherin by immunohistochemical staining supports a diagnosis ductal growth pattern . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 0.6 cm tan lymph node candidate which is submitted in toto in cassette A1 .   ( SR / pwt ) 
B )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 0.3 cm blue - stained lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette B1 .   
( SR / pwt ) C )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 3 " is a 0.5 cm tan rubbery lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette C1 .   
( SR / pwt ) D )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 4 " is a 0.6 cm blue - stained lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette D1 .   ( SR / pwt ) 
E )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 5 " is a 0.2 cm tan lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette E1 .   ( SR / pwt ) 
F )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 6 " is a 0.4 cm tan , blue - stained lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette F1 .   ( SR / pwt ) 
G )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " O'Connell , Alice Jennings , left sentinel lymph node # 7 " is a 2.5 x 1.0 x 0.3 cm lobulated portion of tissue consistent with two lymph nodes .   
Per the surgeon , the specimen ripped during the incision .   
Therefore , this may represent only one lymph node .   
The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette G1 .   ( SR / pwt )
