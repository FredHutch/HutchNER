CLINICAL DATA : Invasive ductal carcinoma . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Weholt , Susan , A. right axillary non - sentinel lymph node " is a 4 x 2.5 x 1.3 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue and lymphoid .   
There is a solitary 4 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm lymph node candidate identified .   
The lymph node candidate is submitted entirely in A1-A2 ( lymph node candidate bisected and composite sections of each bisected half in A1 and A2 , respectively ) .   
( CXH / pwt ) B )     Received fresh labeled " Weholt , Susan , B. right axillary sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.7 cm blue locating dyed lymph node candidate that is bisected and a touch preparation is performed .   
The remainder of the lymph node candidate is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in B1 .   
( CXH / pwt ) C )     Received fresh labeled " Weholt , Susan , C. right axillary sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 1.7 x 1 x 0.8 cm lymph node candidate that is bisected and a touch preparation is performed .   
The remainder of the specimen is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in C1 .   
( CXH / pwt ) D ) Received :   Fresh in a container labeled " Weholt , Susan " and " D. , right breast Lumpectomy . " 
Specimen type :   Lumpectomy Formalin time :   1815 , 3/30 Tissue obtained for tumor banking : No Weight :   19 g Size :   4.5 ML x 3.7 SI x 1.2 AP cm , 3 x 1.2 cm skin on anterior surface Oriented With :   Short suture superior , long suture lateral Ink :   Per protocol " by the surgeon " :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 6 sections of 0.4 cm average thickness with 1 cm ends Findings : Lesion # 1 :   White firm stellate lesion in slices 3 and 4
