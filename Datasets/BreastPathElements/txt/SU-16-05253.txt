CLINICAL DATA : Left breast cancer .   
C50.912 . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , A. sentinel node # 1 " is a 2.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm portion of adipose tissue with a 0.8 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The node is bisected and entirely submitted in A1 . 
B )     Received fresh labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , B. sentinel node # 2 " is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm portion of adipose tissue with a 0.7 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The tissue is entirely submitted in B1 . 
C )     Received fresh labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , C. sentinel node # 3 " is a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue .   
Touch preparations are performed .   
The node is bisected and entirely submitted in C1 . 
D )     Received fresh labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , D. sentinel node # 4 " is a 0.4 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm blue - dyed possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue .   
The node is bisected and touch preparations are performed .   
The node is entirely submitted in D1 . 
E )     Received fresh in a container labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , left breast , suture marking long lateral , short superior " is a 331 g mastectomy specimen measuring 18 cm from medial to lateral , 16 cm from superior to inferior , and 1.4 cm from anterior to posterior .   
There is a 4.6 x 3.2 cm tan skin ellipse containing nipple and areola , with the pointed end of the skin toward the designated lateral side .   
The nipple areolar complex is 3 x 2.9 cm . 
The short stitch is designated as superior ; by the surgeon , however , it is located at inferior aspect of the specimen by correlation to radiological localization of the lesion in the specimen .   
The specimen is inked as follows :   superior anterior margin - blue , superior inferior margin ( with the short stitch ) - orange , posterior margin - black .   
The specimen is serially sectioned from medial to lateral and reveals a white - tan irregular firm mass ( 1.3 x 1 x 1 cm ) located at 12:00 and 3.8 cm superior to nipple areolar .   
The center of the mass has a cavity with hemorrhage consistent with previous biopsy site .   
The mass is 0.6 cm to the nearest anterior margin and 0.7 cm to the nearest posterior margin .   
The remainder of breast tissue is yellow - tan and unremarkable .   
Representative sections are submitted as follows : E1-E6 - entire mass ( E2 and E3 one composite section , E4 and E5 one composite section ) E7-E8 - fibrous area adjacent to the mass E9 - inner upper quadrant , random section E10 inner lower quadrant , random section E11 - outer upper quadrant , random section E12 - lower outer quadrant , random section E13 - nipple areolar complex ( LC / pwt ) F )     Received fresh labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , F. left breast implant " is a 10.5 x 10.5 x 3.0 cm intact breast implant filled with saline - like fluid .   
The manufacturer 's markings are " X 3 " .   
No soft tissue is identified for microscopic evaluation .   
A photograph is taken . 
G )     Received in formalin labeled " Fitzpatrick , Martha , G. left breast skin " is an 18.0 x 5.0 x 0.3 cm strip of skin .   
No discrete masses or lesions are identified .   
Representative sections are submitted in G1 .
