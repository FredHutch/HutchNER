GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Connolly , Connie Louise , A. R MRI - guided biopsy NME upper outer " are approximately 15 fragmented portions of fibrofatty tissue , up to 0.2 cm diameter x 0.2 - 1.5 cm long , entirely submitted in A1-A2 .

ADDENDUM REASON : To report results of prognostic and predictive markers ADDENDUM : IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A2 Population : Invasive carcinoma Interpreted by :   Nicole K Andeen , MD and Mark R Kilgore , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A2     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     95 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong . 
Allred score 8 of 8 A2     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression ( 1 + ) A2     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     5 % positive cells A2     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     0 % positive cells     Allred score 0 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( formerly HCFA ) as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report .
