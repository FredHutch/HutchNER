The lymph node is entirely submitted in two cassettes .   
( SR / clk ) B )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Murray , Micaela Azcarraga ; right axillary sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 4.0 x 2.0 x 2.0 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue .   
Two lymph node candidates are identified on cut surfaces measuring 0.8 and 3.0 cm in greatest dimension .   
The lymph node candidates are sectioned and have fatty - replaced cut surfaces .   
The lymph nodes are entirely submitted labeled : B1-B4 - largest sectioned lymph node B5 - smaller bisected lymph node ( SR / clk ) C )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Murray , Micaela Azcarraga ; right axillary sentinel lymph node # 3 " is a 2.5 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm portion of fibrofatty tissue .   
Two lymph nodes are identified on cut surfaces measuring 0.6 and 2.0 cm in greatest dimension .   
Lymph nodes are bisected and submitted individually in two cassettes .
