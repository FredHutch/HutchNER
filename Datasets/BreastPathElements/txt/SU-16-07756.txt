COMMENT : Prognostic / predictive markers have been performed on a previous biopsy ( SU-16 - 6613 ) and can be repeated on this current specimen upon request if clinically indicated .   
Of note , no uninvolved background breast parenchyma is identified and the neoplasm is high - grade , therefore , metastasis from another site can not be entirely excluded .   
However , given the previous biopsy is reported as ER positive ( Allred score 5 of 8) , the reported location , and the morphology , the findings are most in keeping with a Nottingham grade III breast primary . 
Clinicoradiographic correlation is required .
