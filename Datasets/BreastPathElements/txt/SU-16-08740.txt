Ductal carcinoma in situ with micropapillary features and the following : a. Intermediate nuclear grade , with comedo - type necrosis . 
b. Size : 1.8 cm c. Microcalcifications present in association with DCIS . 
d. All margins > 0.5 cm . 
e. No residual invasive carcinoma identified .   
See comment . 2 . 2 incidental axillary lymph nodes , negative for carcinoma . 
3 . 
Focal fibrocystic and lactational changes present . 
4 . 
See summary cancer data for overall staging ( including biopsy , SU-16 - 4509 ) A - D ) Right axillary sentinel lymph node # 1-#4 , excisions : 4 lymph nodes ( 1 in each part ) , negative for carcinoma . 
COMMENT : The previous biopsy SU-16 - 04509 is re - reviewed with the current mastectomy specimen with Dr. Dintzis .   
In the biopsy specimen there are foci of neoplasm that share morphologic similarity to adjacent DCIS , however , lack a definitive myoepithelial layer when evaluated by immunohistochemistry for SMMHC , Calponin , and P63 .   
Therefore , these foci are interpreted as an invasive component , despite their similar appearance to the remainder of the DCIS and the DCIS present in the mastectomy specimen .   
Additional IHC is performed on the mastectomy specimen and does not identify an invasive component in the sections examined .   
Therefore , the component interpreted as invasive carcinoma on the biopsy is used in the staging template below 
.
