IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A5 Population : Neoplastic cells Interpreted by :   Paul Dennis Simonson , MD , PhD and Mark R Kilgore , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A5     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     0 % positive cells     Positive internal and external controls A5     Fixation time QA     Fixation time QA on predictive markers     Meets requirements A5     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     Equivocal for over - expression ( 2 + ) A5     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     1 % positive cells A5     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     0 % positive cells     Positive internal and external controls ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

Microscopic examination was used to arrive at the diagnosis unless indicated otherwise . 
ADDENDUM REASON : 
This addendum is issued to report the results of HER2 fluorescence in - situ hybridization studies and to clarify grade / phenotype and in - situ carcinoma . 
ADDENDUM COMMENT : Upon reviewing with Dr. Suzanne Dintzis , we agree that this invasive neoplasm is best categorized as invasive pleomorphic lobular carcinoma , which is supported by the lack of membranous E - cadherin staining by IHC .   
In addition , there is high - grade in - situ neoplasm present which may either represent high - grade DCIS or pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in - situ ( favored , given the patchy granular membranous staining by E - cadherin IHC ) .   
The overall Nottingham grade ( II ) and the remainder of the above report remain unchanged .   
HER2 FISH results are as follows : MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION : A recut slide confirms residual invasive carcinoma in the block . 
DNA ANALYSIS : Source ( Original Label ) : A5 Population : Neoplastic cells Interpreted by :   Mark R Kilgore , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A5     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Her2Neu PROBE     3.9 signals / cell A5     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Chromosome 17 PROBE     4.6 signals / cell Ratio : 0.85         Interpretation : NEGATIVE Unstained sections are prepared and regions of invasive carcinoma are marked by comparison with H&E - stained sections from the same block .   
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA - approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit .   
The prepared slides are then viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the chromosome 17 probe ( green ) , the Her-2/neu probe ( orange ) and DNA ( blue ) to localize nuclei .   
Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed .   
Control slides from non - amplified and low - level amplified tumor cells are prepared simultaneously to ensure reproducibility between assays .   
Results for this morphometric , multiplex assay are listed in the table above . 
Note : 
According to the 2013 ASCO / CAP Guideline Recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer ( J Clin Oncol 2013 ; 31 : 3997 - 4013 ) , ratios for HER2/CEP17 of less than 2.0 are interpreted as negative , ratios greater than or equal to 2.0 are interpreted as positive , and ratios less than 2.0 with an average HER2 signals / cell greater than or equal to 4.0 and less than 6.0 are interpreted as equivocal for gene amplification . 
Alternatively , cancers having single - probe average greater than or equal to 6.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted positive and less than 4.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted as negative .
