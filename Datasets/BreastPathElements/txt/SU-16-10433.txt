C50.911 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Smolinsky , Kim Lauree , A. right axillary sentinel node # 1 " is a 2.0 cm aggregate of adipose tissue with three possible nodes , 0.1 - 0.9 cm .   
The two smaller nodes are inked blue and orange , entirely submitted in A1 ( two largest nodes sectioned ) . 
B )     Received in formalin labeled " Smolinsky , Kim Lauree , B. right axillary sentinel node # 2 " is a 1.4 cm possible lymph node with scant surrounding adipose tissue , sectioned and entirely submitted in B1 . 
C )     Received in formalin labeled " Smolinsky , Kim Lauree , C. right axillary sentinel node # 3 " is a 0.5 cm possible lymph node with surrounding adipose tissue , bisected and entirely submitted in C1 . 
D )     Received in formalin labeled " Smolinsky , Kim Lauree , D. true superomedial margin " is a 9.5 g breast reexcision specimen previously inked red and yellow on one surface designating the new superior medial margins .   
The opposite surface is partially cauterized and is uninked .   
It is 4.5 x 3.2 x 1.7 cm .   
It is sectioned from apparent inferior to superior into sixteen slices numbered respectively .   
There is a mildly firm , white area in slices 11 - 13 , 0.9 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm .   
The firm area is at the new superior margin and the cauterized surface .   
No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is mildly congested , yellow lobulated adipose tissue ( 90% ) intermixed with thin white fibrous tissue ( 10% ) .   
Representative sections are submitted : D1 - slices 1 and 16 ( slice 1 yellow , slice 16 red ) D2 - slices 3 and 5 D3 - slice 7 D4 - slice 9 D5 - slice 11 with firm area D6 - slice 12 with firm area D7 - slice 13 with firm area E )     Received fresh labeled " Smolinsky , Kim Lauree , E. right lower inner segmentectomy " is a 49.0 g oriented portion of fibrofatty tissue with a needle localization wire inserted anteriorly .   
It is 4.0 cm medial to lateral x 3.7 cm superior to inferior x 6.5 cm anterior to posterior with a 5.5 x 1.5 cm ellipse of skin partially overlying the anterior margin .   
It is received previously inked : medial - yellow ;   lateral - orange ;   superior - red ;   inferior - blue ;   anterior ( including skin ) - green ;   posterior - black .   
It is sectioned into 15 slices , numbered respectively from anterior to posterior .   
The needle localization wire terminates in slice 14 .   
Slices 1 and 15 are 1.0 and 0.7 cm thick , respectively .   
The remaining slices are 0.3 to 0.5 cm thick .   
An extremely ill - defined 1.2 x 1.1 x 1.0 cm firm tan stellate mass is in slices 7 - 10 ( coil biopsy clip in slice 7 ) .   
The mass is less than 0.1 cm from the superior and medial margins , 1.1 cm from the lateral margin , 3.2 cm from the inferior margin and widely free of the anterior and posterior margins .   
No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 80% ) intermixed with thin , white fibrous tissue ( 20% ) .   
Representative sections are submitted : E1 - sections from slice 1 ( perpendicular ) E2-E4 - composite slice 4 E5-E7 - tissue adjacent to mass , composite slice 6 E8-E10 - composite slice 7 with mass E11-E13 - composite slice 9 with mass E14-E15 - mass superior two - thirds of slice 10 E16-E17 - slice 11 ( tissue adjacent to mass ) E18 - sections from slice 15 ( perpendicular ) Photograph is taken .   
The specimen was collected 04/21/16 and placed in formalin on 04/22/16 at 7:30 a.m.   Total fixation time 9.5 hours .
