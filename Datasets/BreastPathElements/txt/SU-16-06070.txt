Nottingham grade II : poor tubule formation , intermediate nuclear grade , low mitotic activity . 2 . 
Extent : Involving multiple tissue cores with a maximum contiguous length of 0.9 cm in this sample . 3 . Associated in situ 
component : intermediate grade ductal carcinoma in situ . 4 . Microcalcifications : not identified . 
5 . 
Angiolymphatic invasion : not identified . 
6 . 
Positive for estrogen and progesterone receptor expression ( Allred scores of 8 and 7 of 8) . 
7 . 
Negative for HER2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemical technique ( 1 + ) . 8 . 
See comment . 
COMMENT : E - cadherin immunostain is positive in tumor cells , supporting ductal differentiation . 
The previous biopsy from outside institution is reviewed ( SU16 - 5003 ) . 
The current biopsy shows similar histological and immunohistochemical features . _

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Neoplastic cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     90% positive cells , Allred score 8 of 8     Controls appropriately positive A1     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression ( 1 + )     Controls appropriately positive A1     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     30% positive cells     Controls appropriately positive A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     70% positive cells Allred score 7 of 8     Controls appropriately positive ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .
