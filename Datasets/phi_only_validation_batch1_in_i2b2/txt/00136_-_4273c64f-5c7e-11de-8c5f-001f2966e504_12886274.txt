He has required no blood or platelet transfusion during this interim , and he has received no growth colony stimulating factor . 
Problem # 5 . 
Infectious disease . 
Fever of unknown origin : 
None during this interim . 
Documented bacterial infections : 
He was positive for C . 
difficile and was started on a 10 day course of Flagyl that was started on November 6 , 2009 and completed on November 26 , 2009 . 
He is asymptomatic . 
He has had surveillance blood cultures monitored during this interim , last being on November 24 , 2009 and November 30 , 2009 , and they do remain negative , no growth to date . 
Documented fungal infection : 
None during this interim . 
He does remain on prophylactic fluconazole per standard practice . 
Documented viral infections : Of note , Mr. Fobes is CMV positive , VZV positive , HSV negative , and toxoplasma negative . 
His donor is CMV negative . 
He was switched from prophylactic acyclovir to prophylactic valacyclovir when he was placed on prednisone . 
He has had no CMV reactivation during this interim . 
His CMV continues to be monitored weekly during this interim , and was noted to be negative on November 12 , 2009 and November 24 , 2009 . 
Problem # 6 . 
Pneumonitis . 
None during this interim , he has had no respiratory complaints . 
He has had surveillance chest x - rays on November 5 , 2009 , November 12 , 2009 , and November 20 , 2009 , as he is on steroids . 
His lungs remain clear . 
His heart size is normal and unchanged . 
The aorta is slightly tortuous , the arch is calcified indicating atherosclerosis . 
Otherwise no new changes . 
Problem # 7 . 
Graft - versus - host disease . 
He remains on prophylactic FK - 506 and maintaining a goal level of 5 to 15 . 
His tacrolimus level was decreased on November 16 , 2009 for a level of 14 . 
His tacrolimus was checked on November 20 and was 8 with no changes , and November 24 , 2009 at 7 with no changes . 
On November 16 , he had a skin GVHD that was biopsy proven . 
He was initially placed on 1 mg/kg , but the rash worsened . 
On November 18 , 2009 , he was taken off protocol 2327 and increased to 2 mg / kg . 
He started a prednisone taper , 10 % every 3 days starting on November 26 until reaching 1 mg / kg . 
He is tolerating this taper well . 
His rash covered about approximately 90 % of his BSA , and that is resolving significantly . 
He is had galactomannan levels monitored during this interim and they remain negative . 
He has had weekly blood cultures while he is on steroids and they also remained negative . 
Problem # 8 . 
Regimen related toxicity . 
He has had some nausea , but this has been controlled with Zofran and Ativan . 
He has had his bilirubin that was initially elevated when he was discharged from Inpatient Services , but his bilirubin appears to be resolving . 
This elevated bilirubin was most likely secondary to chemo toxicities . 
His bilirubin was elevated at 2 on November 15 , 2009 . 
His bilirubin has decreased to 1.4 . 
For steroid - induced and tacrolimus induced hypertension , he was started on Norvasc on November 20 , 2009 . 
This is being well - controlled . 
He has had normal transaminase . 
He had a gout flare that was resolved with initiation of prednisone and fluids on November 15 , 2009 . 
With the prednisone that he was placed on for his skin GVHD , his has gout appears to have completely resolved . 
We may need to start allopurinol while we are tapering his steroids down to a low dose . 
For his hypercalcemia and hypomagnesemia , we are replacing and giving him 1 liter of fluids daily . 
For pertinent steroid - induced hyperglycemia , he was started on insulin , medium sliding scale and preprandial on November 20 , 2009 . 
His glucose levels continue to be elevated in the 300 to low 400s . 
He is now on preprandial 12 units prior to each meal with glargine 25 units , and changed to a higher algorithm sliding scale . 
PERTINENT PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FINDINGS
