There is a 1.5 mm left basilar nodule ( 3 - 76 ) . 
According to Fleischner society criteria , in a low risk individual such is a non - smoker , no further followup is required . 
In a high - risk individual , recommend repeat low - dose chest CT in 12 months . 
No evidence of a fungal infection . 
The previously mentioned small pulmonary nodules are likely incidental . 
There is a 2.3 x 0.9 cm left paraseptal air - filled cavity posteriorly ( 03 - 39 ) . 
The lungs are otherwise clear . 
The pleural space is clear . 
Left PICC terminates in the distal SVC . 
The supraclavicular area is normal . 
No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy . 
The main pulmonary artery is slightly enlarged at 3.2 cm in transverse diameter , raising the question of pulmonary hypertension . 
A small pericardial effusion may be physiologic . 
Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen on this noncontrast examination reveals a cyst at the superior pole of the right kidney , as before . 
No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesions . 
ASSESSMENT & PLAN 54 yo woman with AML s/p induction with 7 + 3 + hedgehog inhibitor ( Day 1 = 4 / 3 ) who is admitted with neutropenic fever thought secondary to enteritis , course complicated by persistent fevers , rash , and SVT . 
# Neutropenic fever : Source is most likely enteritis / gut translocation given presenting symptoms and CT findings . 
However , all blood cultures , urine cultures , skin biopsy cultures , stool cultures , stool O & P , C diff testing remain negative thus far . 
Patient was having persistent fevers despite coverage with vancomycin / meropenem , so metronidazole and micafungin were added , but vancomycin was discontinued 4 / 26 without significant change . 
Persistently overnight fever . 
The onset correlated with return of neutrophil counts , and ANC is now > 500 . 
It is very difficult to determine which anti - microbial , if any , were effective as all culture data has remained negative . 
- - continue PO metronidazole ( 4 / 23 - 05 / 01 ) - - discontinue micafungin ( 4 / 24 - present ) - - continue acyclovir ppx for next 10 days until outpatient follow up labs - - f/u serum galactomannan - - f/u stool culture , O & P - - f/u biopsy cultures as below - - f/u urine and blood cultures ( both here and Valley ) # Rash Unclear etiology , rash improving - differential diagnosis includes Sweet 's syndrome , drug rash , erythema nodosum , fungal infection . 
Final pathology likely to be back on Monday . 
- appreciate dermatology consult - follow - up biopsy / culture results with PCP or outpatient oncologist - sutures to be removed on approx 5 / 5 as outpatient # Acute Kidney Injury Possibly prerenal secondary to significant diarrhea / volume depletion , though persistent creatinine elevation 1.23 - 1.4 during hospital course . 
Concomittant rash raises possibility of AIN , though UA and urine eos not suggestive . 
Patient continues with good urine output , Cr showed some mild improvement . 
now stable and euvolemic . 
# AML Molecular studies neg ( FLT3 , NPM1 , and CEBPA ) , cytogenetics 46 XX , FISH normal . 
S/p induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3 ( day 1 = 4 / 3 ) , now showing some count recovery . 
Continues on hedgehog inhibitor study drug as per protocol . 
- continue hedgehog inhibitor study drug - patient to be NPO 2 hours prior and post - transfusion thresholds : Hct < 26 , Plts < 10 - Repeat bone marrow Day 26 - 28 - follow up outpatient 04 / 30 and 05 / 02 
# SVT : 
Patient has been experiencing intermittent runs of SVT , which appear to include multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation . 
Tend to occur with activity and fevers . 
Has remained with stable BP during episodes . 
- continue telemetry - continue increased metoprolol to 25 mg PO Q6hours - plan to convert to succinate prior to discharge once on stable dose - keep K > 4.0 , Mg > 2.0 - continue to bolus fluids as necessary for infection # Diarrhea : Improving . 
Most likely related to chemo toxicity . 
Cdiff neg , stool culture and O & P remain pending . 
Improvement with return of neutrophils , patient now tolerating full diet . 
- - Loperamide PRN - - f/u stool studies FEN : immunosupressed diet T / L / D : L PICC , R PIV 
VTE prophylaxis : SCDs and ambulation Contacts : 
Husband Jonathan 206 - 240 - 7941 , Daughter Bethany 206 - 853 - 7160 Code status : FULL Discharge plan : pending resolution of neutropenia / fevers , possibly on 4 / 28 
ATTENDING STATEMENT : I personally saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Stewart 's note . 
Additional diagnoses : none .
