Hospital Day : 4 Chief Concern 39 yo gentleman , currently on IAP for treatment for relapse poor risk AML transferred out of the ICU today after admission for neutropenic fever . 
Interval History In brief this is a 39 yo gentleman who was diagnosed with AML in January of 2014 . 
He underwent induction with 7 + 3 in Spokane for poor risk AML which he completed on 1/17/14 . 
In the process of getting worked up for bone marrow transplant it was noticed that his AML had relapsed . 
He was re - induced with IAP chemo on 4/7/14 . 
Six days later he developed a rash after a routine blood transfusion on 4/13/14 and the following day was admitted for neutropenic fever , severe diarrhea , and tachycardia . 
He 's had an extensive infectious work up with only notable positive finding being + rhinovirus PCR . 
He had extensive imaging including CT C / A / P and abdominal ultrasound all of which were unrevealing . 
His cultures have also remained NTGD . 
He 's been treated broadly with vanc - meropenam and azithromycin . 
Vanco was stopped on 4 / 17 and he is slated to finish azithromycin today 4 / 18 . 
He 's continued to have ongoing large volume diarrhea requiring mIVF and intermittent boluses as well as electrolyte repletion which the team has been attributing to chemo related toxicity given the neg infectious workup including neg cdiff . 
His diarrhea has gradually been improving . 
His hospital course has also been notable for ongoing sinus tachycardia with HRs in the 130s - 150s which kept him in the ICU . 
These HRs have not been fluid responsive and have gradually improved to the 120 s over the course of his hospitalization . 
Thyroid studies and TTE were within normal limits . 
Regarding his rash , derm was consulted and a biospy was obtained which was c/w recent cytotoxic chemotherapy . 
Was not c/w leukemia cutis , Sweet 's syndrome or infectious causes per derm . 
He is using topical triamcinolone cream and vaseline for symptomatic treatment .
