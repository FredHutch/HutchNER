Discharge Summary Date of Admission : 4/7/2011 Date of Discharge : 
4/12/2011 Discharge Diagnosis : Stage III 
Colon CA 
Resolving pancreatitis Poor nutrition Consults Completed : PT/OT Operations / Procedures : CT abdomen and Pelvis Reason for Admission : 
In brief , Erica was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer after reporting a 6 - month h/o hematochezia . 
She underwent sigmoid colectomy with coloproctostomy on 01/17/2011 . 
She started Folfox + Leucovorin on 02/21/2011 ; she was switched to Xeloda on 03/21/2011 for unclear reasons , which she seemed to tolerate well . 
She then developed acute abdominal pain and diarrhea a few days ago , prompting admission to Yakima Hospital . 
She was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis ( lipase peaking in 500 s ) , but was discharged yesterday morning tolerating full PO . 
Shortly after returning home , however , she experienced diarrhea after eating . 
The diarrhea resolved early this morning after taking loperamide . 
She travelled to SCCA today for a pre - schedule appointment to obtain a second opinion for cancer management . 
Report of T to 100 . 
5F , abdominal pain and diarrhea prompted admission directly from clinic . 
Presently , she endorses intermittent mid - upper abdominal pain , rated 7 - 10/10 . 
It radiates upward into the epigastric region with deep breaths , but otherwise does not radiate . 
It is unchanged since symptom onset five days ago prior to diagnosis of pancreatitis . 
Diarrhea yesterday was watery . 
No N / V , although poor appetite and taking only small amounts of fluids ( mostly ice chips ) . 
Lightheaded with standing today . 
Short - lasting dyspnea consistent with known anxiety . 
No cough . 
No dysuria . 
Only sick contact is father with cold , who last visited her a few days ago . 
Hospital Course : 
Nausea / Vomiting / Diarrhea / Abdominal Pain : 
Patient 's symptoms were slow to resolve . 
For several days , she required multiple doses of IV antiemetics , with zofran primarily . 
Initially , all attempts at eating solid foods caused increased crampy pain , emesis , and increased diarrhea . 
Pain was controlled with IV morphine . 
This persisted for long enough that TPN was considered . 
Most of her pain / emesis was initially attributed to her resolving pancreatitis . 
Her diarrhea had been a problem for several weeks , and was attributed largely to the high - dose xeloda and leucovorin interaction . 
The was ruled out for c diff . 
CT abdomen and pelvis was obtained , which showed perhaps some increased inflammation in the cecum at her prior surgical site , and a possible liver infarct . 
Despite the radiographic appearance , LFTs were always normal on admission and on recheck , lactate was normal , and there was really no corroborating evidence of a liver infarct . 
This was likely a false appearance , perhaps related to contrast timing or inflammation from recent pancreatitis . 
It did not appear c/w a met , and she has had multiple prior imaging studies that did not reveal a metastasis in this area . 
The increased colonic inflammation was difficult to interpret in the setting of recent chemo , surgery , and diarrhea . 
Given her fever / nausea / diarrhea / and appearance of possible colitis on CT , a diagnosis of viral gastroenteritis in addition to chemo toxicity seemed likely . 
The vomiting and diarrhea slowly improved , and by the day prior to discharge she was able to eat essentially a full diet ( full liquids , french toast , bagel , oatmeal ) , she was down to 1 - 2 loose stools / day , she was taking oral antiemetics , and her abdominal pain was mild and well - controlled with po morphine . 
Fever : 
Patient was pan - cultured several times without revealing a cause , c diff negative . 
As above , this was eventually attributed to a viral illness . 
She was not treated with antibiotics and was not neutropenic , and defervesced without intervention . 
Anemia : 
Patient was notably anemic , c/w iron deficiency . 
we did not start supplementation 2 / 2 her tenuous GI status , but she would likely benefit from iron when feeling better .
