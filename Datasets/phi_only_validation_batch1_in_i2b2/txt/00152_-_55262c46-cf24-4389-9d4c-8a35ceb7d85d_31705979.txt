In our visit today he admits that he has been facing some big decisions about how he would like to spend his last few years of life . 
He states that over the past few months he has been struggling with chemo toxicities of fatigue , skin changes , hair loss , and the impact this has on his work life , both in terms of symptoms and time away from his work . 
He states very clearly that he would prefer to live a shorter life without chemo toxicities than to extend his life for an uncertain amount of time while struggling with chemo side effects and treatment visits .

ASSESSMENT / PLAN Elson Floyd is a very pleasant 57 - year - old gentleman with metastatic colorectal cancer who has demonstrated ongoing response to FOLFIRI plus Avastin . 
However , due to patient preference , he requests that we hold chemotherapy today . 
We spent some time discussing his options of transitioning to a more manageable regimen , perhaps with oral chemotherapy , either now or at some point in the future . 
I have suggested that he return in two weeks for a discussion with Dr. Harris prior to his next scheduled chemo , and he is in agreement . 
SRO has been submitted to make this change . 
Follow up . 
He is scheduled to return to clinic on August 30 th for chemo and a provider visit prior to infusion . 
I reminded him to contact us at any point between now and then for questions or earlier return visit .
