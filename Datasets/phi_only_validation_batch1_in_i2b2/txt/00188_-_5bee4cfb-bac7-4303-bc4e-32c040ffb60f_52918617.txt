, start Tamoxifen ? 
Hi Annette , 1 . 
Referral to derm is in . 
Perhaps some of the toe tingling is from TC ? 
2 . I wanted to make sure that her chemo toxicities are more or less resolved before she starts tamoxifen . 
It sounds like she 's doing ok , so she should be good to start at her convenience . 
Could you do a phone teach with her for this drug ? 
We went over side effects , but she may need a reminder . 
If she wants to postpone start until after her Montana trip , that 's OK if it 's a week or two . 
3 . 
She can start her injections for expanders . 
4 . 
We should remind her to f/u with her gyn surgeon to discuss BSO timing .
