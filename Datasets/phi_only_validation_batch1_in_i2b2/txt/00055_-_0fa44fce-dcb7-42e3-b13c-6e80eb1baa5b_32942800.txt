ATTENDING STATEMENT : I saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Katie Siebert 's note . 
I personally Reviewed the potential causes of thrombocytopenia with Ms. Anderson . 
As noted above , The most likely etiology is chemotherapy toxicity from paclitaxel . 
Her macrocytosis is most likely explained by nutritional deficiency or ongoing reticulocytosis which will push up the MCV , which is an average measurement of red blood cell size . 
One would anticipate a rebound and a platelet counts off of cytotoxic chemotherapy as her biological therapy is not typically associated with specific cytopenias . 
We will take a conservative approach with further laboratories and reserve bone marrow biopsy only if there is progression or compelling evidence for occult marrow problems . .
