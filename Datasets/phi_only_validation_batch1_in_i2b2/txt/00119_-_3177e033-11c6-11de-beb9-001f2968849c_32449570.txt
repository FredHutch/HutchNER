Hospital Day : 7 Chief Concern ( Required for all billing levels ) 
This is a 74 year old woman who was admitted to the hematology floor for treatment of HLH , currently undergoing chemotherapy , who is transferred to the BMT / ONC ICU after code blue on the floor . 
History of Present Illness Ms. Parker is a 74 y/o woman with refractory ITP and recurrent thrombocytopenia who was transferred from an OSH on 9 / 30 for further evaluation after hemophagocytosis was seen on her bone marrow biopsy . 
She has been admitted to the heme / onc service since that time for tx of HLH and was about to receive day 4 of EPOCH . 
She had been on dexamethasone from admission until 10 / 4 ( after the initiation of chemotherapy ) . 
She reportedly had been tolerating chemotherapy very well without any complications until tonight . 
Tonight , at appx 2200 , code blue was called . 
Per Rachel , the patient 's nurse , the patient was talking and in her usual state as Rachel was about to hang the chemotherapy . 
Suddenly , her eyes rolled back and she became unresponsive . 
She was found to be pulseless at this time . 
CPR was initiated immediately and code team , including myself , arrived to the bedside . 
Initial rhythm after one round of CPR was PEA ( narrow complex , pulseles ) . 
She received epinephrine and underwent another cycle of CPR . 
Subsequently , pulse was obtained with a normal blood pressure and tachycardia to the 130 's . 
Patient was intubated at this time . 
Within minutes , she lost her pulse again and was in ventricular tachycardia . 
She was shocked and given 300 mg of amiodorone with return of spontaneous circulation . 
Labs obtained during the code were remarkable for an alkalosis to 7.5 , lactate of 10 , low calcium . 
Since that time , she has maintained MAPs > 65 ( not on pressors ) and has been tachycardic to appx 100 . 
She is intubated and sedated , but is moving all extremities . 
She was then transferred to the ICU for further care .

Assessment / Plan 
This is a 74 year old woman who was admitted to the hematology floor for treatment of HLH , currently undergoing chemotherapy , who is transferred to the BMT / ONC ICU after code blue on the floor . 
# Cardiac Arrest : 
Initially PEA arrest but subsequently patient had ventricular tachycardia . 
Unclear what caused this event , but high on the differential are an arrythmia related to chemo toxicity or underlying heart disease or pulmonary embolism ( patient is at high risk of clot given low grade DIC , underlying malignancy ) . 
Of note , patient has a hx of rheumatic heart disease and thus has significant valvular disease ( mod / severe mitral regurg , dilated left atrium , elevated pulmonary pressures ) . 
Patient now hemodynamically normal , though in atrial fibrillation . 
Patient received 300 mg bolus of amiodorone during code blue . 
- Continue amiodorone gtt in the setting of possible arrythmia , ( 1 mg/kg x 6 hours , then 0 . 
5mg 
/ kg x 18 hours ) - Heparin gtt ( no bolus , low dose protocol ) ordered , patient going to CTA chest tonight to evaluate for PE . 
If + for PE , will try to obtain platelets of at least 30 ( preferably > 50 , but may be difficult to obtain in this patient with refractory ITP ) and initiate heparin gtt . 
- Replete electrolytes ( ICa is 0.9 ) , Mg > 2 , K > 4 - ScVO2 62 . 
- Will trend lactate , ABG until normalizes # Ventilatory support : presume patient likely will be able to be extubated in the near future , mental status permitting . 
Will evaluate for PE . 
- CT PE - Fentanyl / midazolam for sedation - A / C , TV 8 , PEEP 5 , Rate 10 ( turned down from 14 for resp alkalosis ) 
# Hemophagocytic Lymphistiocytosis : Patient meets multiple criteria for HLH including cytopenia ( Hgb , Plt ) , elevated ferritin , hemophagocytosis in BM . 
Fasting TG elevated at 549 . 
Other possible criteria to evaluate are fevers , low NK - cell activity , elevated sCD25 . 
Patient is without spleen so unable to evaluate for splenomegaly . 
Patient with thrombocytopenia on presentation plt count of 30 . 
EBV negative . 
CT showing hepatomegaly , supraclavicular , mediastinal , periaortic , retroperitoneal LAD . 
LN biopsy preliminary findings reportly suggestive of T - cell vs diffuse large B cell lymphoma . 
CSF fluid reports from OSH with negative flow cytometry , no malignant cells . 
MRI showing evidence of microvascular changes , no evidence of lymphoma . 
Today would have been day 4 of EPOCH , but this was NOT given . 
- Bone marrow biopsy done 10 / 5 with results pending , will follow up results - HOLDING EPOCH tonight , d / w Dr. Emily Stevens ( Heme / onc fellow , who also d / w Dr. Shustov ) - 
If patient to receive chemo in the future , plan to add Rituximab to regimen . 
Will defer to oncologists - Continue prednisone 100 mg qAM - DIC panel BID ( fibrinogen , D - dimer ) ; will give cryo for fibrinogen < 120 given low grade DIC - TLS : LDH , Uric Acid , BMP DAILY - Daily CBC with diff - Daily LFTs - Continue PPX : Valtrex ( treating shingles ) , Bactrim QMTu , Fluconazole - Tranfusion thresholds : fibrinogen < 120 , platelets > 10 , hct < 25 # Constipation : pt has not had a BM in a few days in the context of vincristine , which is known to be constipating . - 
Scheduled Miralax to BID dosing - Schedule Senna TID # Altered Mental Status : reported prior to transfer . 
Unable to assess currently as patient intubated , sedated # Shingles - Continue Lyrica 100 mg BID - Tylenol PRN - Continue Valtrex 500 mg BID # 
h/o 
ITP : s/p slpenectomy with refractory disease . 
Previous treatments have included cytoxan , decadron , hydroxychloroquine , IV IgG . 
# CAD 
s/p stenting > 10 years ago - Patient reports taking Plavix , has been on hold since admission at OSH ( 9 / 17 ) - Will hold until know patient will no longer need procedures _

prophylaxis : Heparin gtt , pending CT scan , if negative will discontinue FEN : NPO , pending TF vs .
