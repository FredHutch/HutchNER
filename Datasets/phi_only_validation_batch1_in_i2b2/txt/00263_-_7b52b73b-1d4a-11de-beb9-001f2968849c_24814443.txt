Chemo .

Avastin is currently pending insurance approval , and we will hope to administer this early next week once insurance coverage has been secured . 
Ryan is aware of and in agreement with this plan . 2 . 
Chemo toxicities . 
We reviewed possible side effects of chemo , including nausea , fatigue , cold sensitivity , and myelopsuppresion . 
I encouraged him to continue his daily exercise routine to improve chemo - related fatigue . 
In anticipation of post - infusion nausea , I have provided him with rx for dexamethasone 4 mg PO days 2 - 4 . 
He also has multiple antiemetics at home , which we reviewed in detail , as well as Marinol 2.5 mg to take PO BID PRN .

Continue active lifestyle with regular exercise , healthy diet , positive attitude with a focus on stress reduction , support meds as needed . 
Follow up . 
We will be in touch regarding Avastin rescheduling . 
Next cycle of chemo is scheduled for May 18 th and 
I will see him at that time .
