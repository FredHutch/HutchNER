# : Nausea / vomiting and abdominal pain : Chemotherapy side effect is a possibility , but unclear whether this would take a weak to manifest after only one dose and unusual that nausea should be progressive unless as pt indicates there is some anticipatory component . 
Small bowel obstruction also on differential given hx of abdominal surgery , however , BS active and AXR w / o airfluid level . 
Gastroenteritis or systemic infectionn possibilities , especially given neutropenia . 
To be prudent , CNS metastasis should be ruled out although unlikely in the setting of essentially normal neuro exam and no neurological complaints . 
- Chem 10 , CBC and LFTs - UA , urine and blood cultures to assess for infection - Abdominal series to assess for SBO - Brain MRI to assess for metastasis - IV fluids - IV antiemetics # 
Neutropenia : rapid drop in anc from above 3000 yesterday to 270 today . 
Likely secondary to pemetrexed . 
- Daily cbc with diff - Levaquin 500 mg IV Qday # Metastatic stage IV SCLC / goals of care : pt hesitant about code status today and in general seemed very distraught by admission . 
- will continue to address code status / goals of care with pt , but utlimately defer to outpt doc # Anxiety / Depression : - continue zoloft , clonazepam 
# Prophy : TED hose / SCDs , hold heparin while thrombocytopenic # FEN : D5NS @ 125 , advance diet as tolerated # CODE : full , will continue to address with pt #

ATTENDING STATEMENT I saw and examined Ms Oliver with Dr Bomsztyk and agree with her documentation above . 
Ms Oliver has metastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer s/p recent chemotherapy with pemetrexed who was admitted with nausea , vomiting , and abdominal discomfort . 
Her abdomen is not acute and i think this is most likely chemotherapy toxicity . 
If her nausea persists or seems projectile we will image her brain to r/o brain metastases . 
The date of service is 1/6/10 .
