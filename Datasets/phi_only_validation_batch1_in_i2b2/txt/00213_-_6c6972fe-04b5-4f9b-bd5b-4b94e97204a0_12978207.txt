ID / CC : 57 yo man with R thigh sarcoma , admitted for 3 rd cycle of chemo ( just ifosfamide this admit ) . 
HPI : 
Mr. Cummins was diagnosed with pleomorphic sarcoma of his R thigh 10 / 09 . 
Please see prior SCCA and heme onc notes for complete details of his prior workup and history . 
In brief , he had a biopsy that confirmed the sarcoma and a CT or chest and abdomen concerning for possible mets , but a PET scan that only showed the lesion in his thigh as hypermetabolic . 
Has undergone two courses of Adriamycin and Isosfamide as adjuvant therapy prior to a surgical resection but by MRI 12/11/09 , the sarcoma was enlarging and the patient tells me ( no SCCA note up yet ) that he met with his oncology team earlier today at the SCCA and the current plan is for him to get Ifosfamide only this admission and then local radiation in the near future . 
Mr. Cummins says he is well today with only a minimal amount of L hip pain ( posterior L hip pain without radiation ) . 
Says he has done well following his last chemo course ( d/c 11/30/09 ) without significant nausea . 
WBC has been elevated prior to most admissions ( pt thinks this is 2 / 2 his neulasta ) . 
He does not feel ill .

Compared to examination dated November 15 , 2009 there has been significant increase in size of large necrotic lobulated mass within the medial right thigh consistent with progression of known high grade undifferentiated sarcoma . 
2 . 
Previously noted postoperative seroma in the medial and posterior thigh is decreased in size compared to prior examination with only a sliver of remaining fluid present . 
Problems / Assessment / Plan # ) R thigh sarcoma # ) A - fib , rate controlled Plan : - admit for ifosfamide therapy ( cycle 3 ) , plan 5 day course - pretreating with mesna and albumin - D5W with 100 meQ sodium acetate , 20 meQ KCL and 4 meQ Mag sulfate at 83 cc/hr to start 2 h before chem and d/c at discharge ( per SCCA chemo orders ) - daily chem 10 and CBC - daily urine dipstick looking for hematuria - neuro check with nursing q shift - monitor for signs of chemo toxicity ( cardiomyopathy , hemorrhagic cystitis , neurotoxicity , etc . ) - anti - emetics ( ativan pretreament , Emend , dexamethasone , zofran prn , compazine prn , reglan prn ) - leukocytosis likely 2 / 2 the neulasta 
, no plans for further workup unless more convincing signs and symptoms of infection develop - will get neulasta with SCCA after d/c Full CODE ambulate for DVT prophy and TEDS / SCDS while asleep or lying in bed Stephen Wiest , MD R3 Internal Medicine
