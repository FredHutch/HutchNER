Problems / Assessment / Plan 54 yo woman recently diagnosed with AML , now s/p induction ( day 1 was 4/3/13 ) , and recently discharged from hospital on ceftazidime after admission for neutropenic fever , now re - admitted with abd pain and neutropenic fever . 
# Neutropenic fever : Source is most likely enteritis / gut translocation given presenting symptoms and CT findings . 
Unfortunately , patient has remained febrile despite broad spectrum anti - bacterial coverage . 
All blood and urine cultures remain negative thus far . 
Gram stain and fungal stain from biopsies of rash are also negative . 
C diff testing negative x 2 , stool O & P and cultures pending . 
ANC continues to show improvement , which should help substantially with resolution of her underlying infectious process . 
- - continue vancomycin , meropenam , and metronidazole - - continue micafungin - - send serum galactomannan - - f/u stool culture , O & P - - f/u biopsy cultures as below - - f/u urine and blood cultures ( both here and Valley ) # Rash Unclear etiology , differential diagnosis includes Sweet 's syndrome , drug rash , erythema nodosum , fungal infection . 
- appreciate dermatology consult - follow - up biopsy / culture results - sutures to be removed on approx 5 / 4 # Acute Kidney Injury Possibly prerenal secondary to significant diarrhea / volume depletion . 
However , urine Na 86 and FeNa 2.3 % argue somewhat against this etiology . 
Concomittant rash raises possibility of AIN . 
Infectious - related GN is another consideration . 
- urinalysis , urine eos - repeat BMP after fluids and blood products today # AML Molecular studies neg ( FLT3 , NPM1 , and CEBPA ) , cytogenetics 46 XX , FISH normal . 
S/p induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3 ( day 1 = 4 / 3 ) , now pancytopenic . 
Continues on hedgehog inhibitor study drug as per protocol . 
- continue hedgehog inhibitor study drug - patient to be NPO 2 hours prior and post - transfusion thresholds : Hct < 26 , Plts < 10 - Repeat bone marrow Day 26 - 28 # SVT : Patient has been experiencing intermittent runs of SVT , which appear to include multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation . 
The runs had been non - sustained , but were occurring with increasing frequency and patient is symptomatic during the episodes . 
Now much improved after starting metoprolol . 
- continue telemetry - continue metoprolol 12 . 
5mg PO Q6hours - plan to convert to succinate prior to discharge - keep K > 4.0 , Mg > 2.0 - continue to bolus fluids as necessary for infection # Diarrhea : Most likely related to chemo toxicity . 
Cdiff neg , stool culture and O & P remain pending . 
Now starting to improve with return of neutrophils , patient now tolerating full diet . 
- - Loperamide PRN - - f/u stool studies - - add banana flakes as bulking agent today FEN : immunosupressed diet T / L / D : L PICC , R PIV

I personally saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Jayne - Jensen 's note . 
Additional diagnoses : none .
