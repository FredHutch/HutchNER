No evidence of intra - abdominal hemorrhage . 2 . 
Prominent appendix with mild hazy pericecal fat stranding and small lymph nodes . 
Findings concerning for possible early appendicitis . 
Problems / Assessment / Plan 61 year old female with progressive AML ( NPM1 and FLT3 + ) , now on day 42 s/p low dose Ara - C and sorafenib with day 21 
BM showing 20 % blasts . 
Now day 20 s/p reinduction with decitabine / cytarabine , day 14 BM showing 2 % blasts . 
Overall plan is for additional chemotherapy , likely prior to returning to Alaska . 
Hospital course most recently complicated by anemia requiring daily transfusion , concerns for GI bleed versus other blood loss . 
# 
Abdominal pain : Diffuse abdominal pain with stable abdominal exam , no peritoneal signs . 
CT A/P with early signs of appendicitis . 
- Surgery consulted - Clear liquids until midnight , then NPO overnight . 
- broadened antibiotics from levofloxacin - > meropenem - Repeat CT tomorrow ( 9 / 18 ) # Persistent anemia requiring transfusion , concern for slow GI bleed versus occult abdominal bleed : Etiology uncertain . 
Other etiologies such as chemotherapy toxicity less likely given the magnitude ( needs 1 unit per day ) , DIC panel and hemolysis labs were negative . 
Post - transfusion hct and plts have showed appropriate increase . 
- CT A/P without obvious source of bleed , but early signs of appendicitis ( see above ) - continue aminocaproic acid 2 gm q6 hrs , continue transfusion thresholds of > 50 k - continue protonix 40 mg IV BID for possible GIB - defer GI consult while pt neutropenic / thrombocytopenic ( as she can not have interventions ) # AML with pancytopenia : { Normal karyotype , NPM1 positive , FLT3 - ITD positive with allelic ratio 0.66 } Treatment has been : 2 doses decitabine from 2 / 13 to 3 / 13 with GCSF support followed by 14 days of Low dose Ara - C ( 8 / 8 ) and sorafenib ( 8 / 9 ) initiated for 14 days , followed by AraC / decitabine ( date 1 = 8 / 29 ) . 
With these treatments she continued to have persistent abnl myeloid blasts on cytology / flow , but BM population has decreased from 75 to 20 % to 3 % after each treatment . 
Overall plan is for another course of chemotherapy with a goal of acheiving remission . 
- - plan for day 21 BM ( 9 / 18 ) followed by potentially another chemo course - - transfusion thresholds : hct > 26 , plts > 50 - - prophylaxis : fluconazole PO acyclovir ( treatment dose completed 8 / 20 ) levofloxacin ( switched from Vanc 8 / 21 ) Chronic medical problems : # DM type II : BGs stable inpatient . 
Not on medications at home . 
SSI if needed # FEN : No MIVF as patient tolerating PO . 
monitor and replete electrolytes as needed . 
# Prophylaxis : SCDs and ambulation 
# Code status : 
FULL # Contacts : brother ( George ) 406 - 665 - 5634 # Dispo : provider in Alaska will be Dr. Ornis at Alaska Native Medical Center . 
Patient would like to continue to pursue aggressive therapy .
