Ms. Kapff tolerated cycle 4 of dose modified ( escalated per protocol ) R - EPOCH for EBV - associated mediastinal B - cell lymphoma , likely large cell . 
Tolerated well as usual . 
Does endorse , day of discharge , ' chills , ' which are likely hot flashes due to chemo toxicity to ovaries . 
At age 32 , this is likely to be temporary . 
Hot flashes generally most bothersome with some endogeneous estrogen around , which I would expect in her case . 
Many SSRIs , as well as gabapentin , have been studies and shown to be effective as non - endocrine therapy for hot flashes , if Dr. Budde would prefer eschewing hormone therapy , given its thromboembolic potential . 
On the other hand , it would be exceedingly unlikely to develop additional thromboses while being fully anti - coagulated , as she is . 
In one study , gabapentin was shown to be more effective than estrogen in relieving post - menopausal hot flashes . 
It may also be useful in treating the discomfort of chemotherapy - related peripheral neuropathy ( although not likely to treat the numbness ) .
