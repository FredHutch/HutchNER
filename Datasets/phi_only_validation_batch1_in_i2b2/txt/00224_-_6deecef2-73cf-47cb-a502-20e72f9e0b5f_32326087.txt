Problem List 1 . 
Breast Cancer : Ms. Mata noted left - sided breast lump in 08 / 2012 . 
Bilateral diagnostic mammogram on 10/16/2013 revealed calcifications in the central right breast , focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast and an area of asymmetry in the left axilla . 
Bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound ( U / S ) done 01/11/2013 showed the right breast with only scattered fibroglandular densities ; and 2 left breast masses at 2 o�clock , 9 and 11 cm from the nipple . 
U / S confirmed the 2 masses at 2 o�clock : 2.2 x 1.6 x 2.0 cm mass corresponding to the palpable mass and 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.9 cm ; and a 1.5 cm axillary lymph node ( ALN ) with prominent cortical thickening . 
U / S guided biopsies done 01/11/2013 of the 2 left breast masses at 2 o�clock , 9 and 11 cm , revealed invasive ductal carcinoma , grade 3 , maximum span of invasive carcinoma 1.2 cm , ER + 95 % , PR + 15 % , Ki - 67 50 % , and HER2 negative ( 1+ ) ; without associated in situ carcinoma , calcifications or angiolymphatic invasion . 
Bilateral breast MRI on 01/22/2013 showed benign right breast and two distinct 2 o�clock left breast masses measuring 1.9 x 1.8 x 2.0 cm and 2.0 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm at 7 and 8 cm from the nipple , respectively ; and left level I ALN with mildly thickened cortices . 
A 6 mm enhancing pleural mass was seen in the right anterior thorax as well however PET - CT on 02 / 15 / 2013 was negative for metastatic disease . 
Core needle biopsy of the left ALN done 02/21/2013 showed a reactive LN without metastatic carcinoma . 
Left sided skin sparing mastectomy and sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) biopsy was done on 03/18/2013 with pathology showing invasive ductal carcinoma , 4.5 cm in size , grade 2 - 3 , ER + ( Allred 8 / 8 ) , PR + ( Allred 6 / 8 ) , HER2 1+ ( IHC ) , focal angiolymphatic space invasion present ; associated DCIS and atypical lobular hyperplasia ; 5 SLNs # 1 , # 3 , # 4 negative for carcinoma , # 2 with isolated tumor cell clusters and # 5 with metastatic carcinoma , 0.5 cm , with no extracapsular extension ; and 0 / 6 left axillary level II non - sentinel nodes with carcinoma . 
Oncotype DX revealed a score of 26 and 18 % distant recurrence risk at 10 years . 
Hormone levels done 0 n 09/17/2013 : FSH = 79 and Estradiol = 20 . 
Adjuvant chemotherapy completed between 06/03/2013 - 08/26/2013 with 2 cycles of Q 3 week docetaxel plus cytoxan on 06/03/2013 and 06/28/2013 ; and 2 doses of cytoxan 600 mg / m2 on 07 / 19 and 08 / 11 plus 6 weekly doses of paclitaxel 80 mg / m2 on 07 / 19 , 07 / 28 , 08 / 04 , 08 / 11 , 08 / 18 , 08 / 26 . 
Of note , docetaxel was stopped on 07/19/2013 and substituted with weekly paclitaxel due to docetaxel skin reaction at peripheral infusion site .

History of facial and leg burns at age 7 4 .

Impression and Plan Ms. Mata is a 50 year old woman with left sided stage IIB , pT2pN1aM0 , grade 3 , ER + / PR + , HER - 2 negative , invasive ductal breast carcinoma . 
She is status post left mastectomy and SLN biopsy and has now recently completed taxane - based adjuvant chemotherapy on 08/26/2013 ( see breast cancer history above ) . 
Overall , she tolerated adjuvant chemotherapy fairly well and continues to have an outstanding performance status ( ECOG = 0 ) and is working fulltime . 
Today she reports continued expected taxane - related toxicity of altered appetite / taste and mild to moderate sensory neuropathy of the feet . 
I explained to Ms. Mata , that I expect the symptoms to continue to improve over the next few weeks however , as previously discussed she may have residual neuropathy which will be permanent . 
She does not warrant adjuvant radiation therapy given that she is status post left MRM . 
As previously discussed with Ms. Mata , she is a candidate for adjuvant endocrine therapy to decrease her risk of breast cancer recurrence , given her ER + / PR + breast cancer . 
I discussed with Ms. Mata that we will plan on starting endocrine therapy with an aromatase inhibitor given that her hormone levels ( FSH and estradiol ) are in the menopausal range . 
She is in agreement with this however she is again requesting to hold off on starting adjuvant endocrine therapy until she completes breast expander swap - out surgery which is tentatively scheduled for 12/03/2013 . 
We will plan on seeing Ms. Mata in 6 weeks to evaluate for residual chemotherapy toxicity . 
At that visit , I will also review aromatase inhibitor therapy with her in detail including expected toxicities and benefit . 
I spent 30 minutes with the patient in face - to - face contact , with the majority of that time spent in counseling and coordination of care as noted above
