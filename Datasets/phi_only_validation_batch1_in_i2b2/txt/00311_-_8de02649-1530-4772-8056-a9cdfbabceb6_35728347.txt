Date 04/25/14 23:55 AST ( GOT ) : 26 ALT ( GPT ) : 27 Alk Phos ( Total ) : 52 Bilirubin ( Total ) : 0.8 Albumin : 2.2 Problems / Assessment / Plan 54 yo woman with AML s/p induction with 7 + 3 + hedgehog inhibitor ( Day 1 = 4 / 3 ) who is admitted with neutropenic fever thought secondary to enteritis , course complicated by persistent fevers , rash , and SVT . 
# Neutropenic fever : 
Source is most likely enteritis / gut translocation given presenting symptoms and CT findings . 
However , all blood cultures , urine cultures , skin biopsy cultures , stool cultures , stool O & P , C diff testing remain negative thus far . 
Patient was having persistent fevers despite coverage with vancomycin / meropenem , so metronidazole and micafungin have been added . 
Fever curve is now showing significant improvement . 
The timing of this correlates with return of neutrophil counts , and ANC is now > 500 . 
It is very difficult to determine which anti - microbial , if any , were effective as all culture data has remained negative . 
- - stop vancomycin today ( 4 / 17 - 4 / 26 ) - - continue meropenem ( 4 / 17 - present ) - - continue metronidazole ( 4 / 23 - present ) - - continue micafungin ( 4 / 24 - present ) - - f/u serum galactomannan - - f/u stool culture , O & P - - f/u biopsy cultures as below - - f/u urine and blood cultures ( both here and Valley ) # Rash Unclear etiology , differential diagnosis includes Sweet 's syndrome , drug rash , erythema nodosum , fungal infection . 
Final pathology likely to be back on Monday . 
- appreciate dermatology consult - follow - up biopsy / culture results - sutures to be removed on approx 5 / 5 # Acute Kidney Injury Possibly prerenal secondary to significant diarrhea / volume depletion . 
Concomittant rash raises possibility of AIN , though UA and urine eos not suggestive . 
Patient continues with good urine output , Cr showing mild improvement . 
- maintian euvolemia , bolus IV fluids as necessary # AML Molecular studies neg ( FLT3 , NPM1 , and CEBPA ) , cytogenetics 46 XX , FISH normal . 
S/p induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3 ( day 1 = 4 / 3 ) , now showing some count recovery . 
Continues on hedgehog inhibitor study drug as per protocol . 
- continue hedgehog inhibitor study drug - patient to be NPO 2 hours prior and post - transfusion thresholds : Hct < 26 , Plts < 10 - Repeat bone marrow Day 26 - 28 # SVT : Patient has been experiencing intermittent runs of SVT , which appear to include multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation . 
Tend to occur with activity and fevers . 
Has remained with stable BP during episodes . 
- continue telemetry - increase metoprolol to 25 mg PO Q6hours - plan to convert to succinate prior to discharge - keep K > 4.0 , Mg > 2.0 - continue to bolus fluids as necessary for infection # Diarrhea : Most likely related to chemo toxicity . 
Cdiff neg , stool culture and O & P remain pending . 
Now starting to improve with return of neutrophils , patient now tolerating full diet . 
- - Loperamide PRN - - f/u stool studies FEN : immunosupressed diet 
T / L / D : L PICC , R PIV VTE prophylaxis : SCDs and ambulation Contacts : 
Husband Jonathan 206 - 240 - 7941 , Daughter Bethany 206 - 853 - 7160 
Code status : FULL Discharge plan : pending resolution of neutropenia / fevers , possibly on 4 / 28 ATTENDING STATEMENT : I personally saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Jayne - Jensen 's note . 
Additional diagnoses : none .
