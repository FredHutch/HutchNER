# . 
Acute myelogenous leukemia : Consolidation chemotherapy Day2 ( D1 = 10 / 8 ) with CLAG s/p filgrastim priming . 
Pt is FLT3 + and has translocation of 6 ; 11 and deletion of 9 . 
Pt 's WBC count is reflection of GCSF , and TLS and DIC labs remain unremarkable , and feel comfortable transitioning to qD lab checks . 
- CLAG : 
Filgrastim subcutaneously days 0 - 5 , cladribine days 1 - 5 , and cytarabine IV days 1 - 5 ( 25 % reduction ) . 
- Prophylaxis : 
Allopurinol 300 mg qD , acyclovir 800 mg BID , Posaconazole 200 mg TID , Levaquin 750 mg qHS . 
- Antiemetics per powerplan + scopolamine patch - TLS and DIC labs aD - IVF per powerplan - Transfusion thresholds plt 10 , hct 26 # . 
Seizures : Does not have a dx of epilepsy , but talking with neurology this AM , there is concern that pt 's episodes could be epileptiform in nature , and the bil involvement could represent generalized activity even without LE involvement . 
- Neurology following , appreciate recs - Keppra ( if nauseated convert keppra to IV ; same dose ) - Ativan if seizure > 2 min # 
Low back pain and weakness : pt has long hx and sounds like worsens with intense mood and deconditioning . 
Has some elements of neuropathic involvement with shooting sensation down bil legs to mid thigh area . 
She has hx of " slipped discs " , reports not having any prior back / spine imaging . 
Pt is morbidly obese as well as markedly deconditioned for a woman of her age . 
Her weakness can be further worsening her LBP . 
As far as etiology of weakness , seems to have started around when AML was diagnosed , now using a walker or wheelchair and with slow gait , possibly ataxic altho difficult to tell w / walker assistance . 
Again concern for chemo toxicity , but also could be severe deconditioning from severe illness induced myopathy when pt in ICU in September 2014 . 
- Consider starting gabapentin 300 mg qHS - PT/OT # . 
Memory deficits : 
Unclear etiology at this time . 
Ddx includes iatrogenic / toxic from medications , possible post - ictal state as well as PTSD . 
Most likely this is a chemotherapy side effect , and hope memory clears with time . 
Further evaluation of seizures as above , but keppra can also cause a sedation - like state , although mild , which could contribute . 
Pt does not have hx of PTSD , but this is also known to cause memory deficits . 
- CTM # . 
Diarrhea : likely chemo related or IBS as pt having difficulties with anxiety and mood lately . 
- C diff pending , if negative can give loperamide and probiotics . 
# . 
Adjustment disorder with anxiety : pt followed by psychologist as outpt . 
Diagnosed after AML , - Sertraline Lines : 
L PICC 
DVT 
ppx : lovenox until platelets < 50 FENGI / Diet : immunosuppressed diet , Replete pt 's hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia for goal K of 4 and Mg of 2 .
