DIAGNOSTIC TESTS 
EKG : from 7/13/12 shows NSR with noisy baseline ; possible RSR or QR pattern in V1 suggestive of right ventricular conduction delay . 
T wave abnormality not present . 
QTc 368 . 
IMPRESSION Marcia Friedman is a 70 - year - old postmenopausal woman with metastatic and BRCA1 - associated breast cancer . 
Sites of disease include diffuse bony metastasis as well as new hepatic lesions . 
Ms. Friedman 's history includes a diagnosis of node - positive left breast cancer in 1982 , treated with lumpectomy , axillary node dissection , whole breast radiation , adjuvant CMF for nine months , and then extended tamoxifen for 20+ years , discontinued in 2006 . 
She presented with metastatic breast cancer with bone pain in 2010 . 
Metastatic disease was confirmed by bone biopsy revealing ER positive , PR positive , and HER - 2 negative disease . 
She has received radiation to the L5 and T5 regions and has received 2 lines of endocrine therapy , the first with an aromatase inhibitor for a duration of approximately 12 months , and then most recently with fulvestrant with progression documented after approximately 10 months in March 2012 . 
She has continued on bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid every 4 to 6 weeks . 
Most recently Ms. Friedman 's LFTs were increased to the point that she was no longer eligible for the particular study locally . 
She reached out to our center and is interested in participating in our phase I clinical trial of ABT - 888 in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine for patients with triple negative or BRCA1 or 2 - associated advanced breast cancer . 
Marcia has is now day 8 of cycle 3 . 
Her initial cycle was complicated by nausea , vomitting , and fatigue , but no DLT events . 
LFTs and alk phos continue to decrease which is encouraging . 
Previous QTc prolongation not present on EKG today . 
Nausea , anorexia and fatigue persist . 
LE edema improved . 
RECOMMENDATIONS 1 . 
No DLT in cycle 1 and 2 . 
2 . 
Will proceed with cycle 3 , day 8 today . 
3 . 
Given increase in nausea and possible orthostasis , advised Marcia to increase PO fluid intake to at least 3 L daily . 
Will add an additional 500 cc of NS to fluids today . 
4 . 
Continue with antiemetic regimen including dexamethasone on day 2 , 3 after cisplatin . 
5 . 
Continue with zometa 4 mg IV Q6 weeks , dose today . 
6 . 
Add iron studies to labs next week and consider iron sucrose for chemotherapy - induced anemia if indicated . 
Also discussed potential for PRBC transfusion . 
7 . 
Requested that Ms. Friedman request copy of her BRCA1 testing report from 2001 for inclusion in her medical record . 
8 Restaging after cycle 3 per protocol . 
Marcia will be seen next week ( day 15 ) by Sheila Hoelscher , ARNP . 
I will see her back the following week to review restaging studies . 
At the conclusion of our meeting today , I believe that Ms. Friedman 's questions were addressed . 
I spent 25 minutes with the patient today , the majority of which was in face - to - face counseling and coordination of care regarding management of chemotherapy toxicites for TNBC .
