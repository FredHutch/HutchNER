ID / CC Ms. Mata is a 50 year old female with recently diagnosed left - sided stage IIB ( pT2pN1aM0 ) grade 3 , strongly ER / PR positive , HER - 2 negative , invasive ductal breast carcinoma . 
She is now status post left mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy . 
She is currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy specifically , paclitaxel and cyclophosphamide ( cytoxan ) and is here today for routine chemotherapy follow - up . 
Interval History Ms. Mata was last seen by me on 07 / 17 / 2013 . 
At that time she was noted to have had erythema , increased warmth and subsequent blistering at the PIV site 5 days after receiving her second dose of docetaxel on 06/28/2013 . 
The blister was lanced and she was treated with keflex ; and had complete resolution of the affected site . 
Regardless , there was concern for docetaxel related infusion reaction ( skin lesion ) versus infection ; and docetaxel was discontinued . 
Weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg / m2 ( to be given for a total of 6 doses ) was substituted with continuation of 2 more doses of IV cyclophosphamide given every 3 weeks in order to replace the remaining 2 cycles of TC . 
Additionally , we held the Neulasta and have closely followed her blood counts with the weekly paclitaxel . 
At this time , Ms. Mata has completed the 2 additional doses of cyclophosphamide and 4 of 6 planned paclitaxel doses . 
She has had no further reactions at the site of chemotherapy infusion . 
Overall , she is tolerating chemotherapy well but has noted increasing fatigue and decreased stamina over the past 2 weeks . 
While she continues to work fulltime she readily admits to having to exert significant effort to get to work ; and she expresses relief that she is almost done with chemotherapy . 
She reports that her gastric reflux is now well controlled with ranitidine and she has stopped the omeprazole . 
She had mild nausea after the cytoxan which was well controlled with ondansetron . 
Her appetite remains good and weight has been stable . 
She endorses complete hair loss from her head . 
She denies mouth sores , vomiting , diarrhea , fevers , chills , redness / tenderness of palms or to soles of feet . 
She also denies numbness or tingling of hands or feet . 
Problem List 1 . 
Breast Cancer : Baseline level of health until noting painful left - sided breast lump in August 2012 . 
She saw her PCP in September and underwent bilateral diagnostic mammogram on October 16 , 2013 which revealed calcifications in the central right breast on one projection , focal asymmetry in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast and another area of asymmetry in the left axilla on MLO projection . 
After UWMC review of this film , bilateral diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were done January 11 , 2013 where mammogram showed two indistinct left breast masses at 2 o�clock . 
On ultrasound these were a 2.2 x 1.6 x 2.0 cm mass 9 cm from the nipple , corresponding to the palpable mass , and a 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.9 cm mass at 2 o�clock 11 cm from the nipple . 
In addition ultrasound demonstrated a 1.5 cm axillary node with prominent cortical thickening . 
The right breast on mammogram showed only scattered fibroglandular densities . 
She underwent ultrasound - guided biopsies of the two 2 o�clock left breast masses which revealed invasive ductal carcinoma , Nottingham grade 3 , maximum span of invasive carcinoma 1.2 cm , without associated in situ carcinoma , calcifications or angiolymphatic invasion , ER positive 95 % , PR positive 15 % , Ki - 67 50 % , and HER2 negative ( 1+ ) . 
She had breast MRI on January 22 , 130 that demonstrated two distinct 2 o�clock left breast masses each containing a biopsy clip : a round irregular 1.9 x 1.8 x 2.0 cm mass 7 cm from the nipple and a round irregular 2.0 x 1.9 x 1.9 cm mass 8 cm from the nipple . 
In the left axilla were seen level I lymph nodes with mildly thickened cortices , asymmetric compared to the right , suspicious . 
The right breast was benign . 
A 6 mm enhancing pleural mass was seen in the right anterior thorax as well . 
She underwent PET - CT on February 15 , 2013 which was negative for metastatic disease . 
She underwent biopsy of the left axilla which was negative on February 21 , 2013 . 
She underwent left sided skin sparing mastectomy and sentinel node procedure . 
Unfortunately , her sentinel nodes were positive , prompting an axillary dissection on March 18 , 2013 with pathology revealing a single span of invasive ductal carcinoma , 4.5 cm , grade 2 , with the pathology comment of low proliferation rate on inspection . 
5 sentinel nodes were biopsied , 1 with a 5 - mm metastatic focus of carcinoma , no extracapsular extension , 1 with focal cancer cells , and 3 with no evidence of tumor . 
Oncotype DX testing revealed a score of 26 , conferring an 18 % distant recurrence risk at 10 years assuming 5 years of tamoxifen . 
Started on adjuvant docetaxel / cytoxan given every 3 weeks on 06/03/2013 . 
The docetaxel was discontinued and substituted with weekly paclitaxel 80 mg / m2 on 07/19/2013 given concern for docetaxel related skin reaction at site of peripheral infusion .

She is now status post left mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy . 
Ms. Mata was initially started on adjuvant docetaxel / cytoxan chemotherapy and received 2 cycles on 06/03/2013 and 06/28/2013 . 
However , the docetaxel was discontinued and substituted with weekly paclitaxel 80mg / m2 on 07/19/2013 due to possible docetaxel skin reaction at site of infusion . 
She was continued on every 3 week IV cytoxan 600 mg / m2 and has completed a total of 4 cycles . 
Additionally , she has completed 4 of 6 weekly cycles of paclitaxel on 07/19/2013 , 07/28/2103 , 08/04/2013 , and 08/11/2013 . 
Overall , she is tolerating chemotherapy fairly well with expected mild nausea . 
Her previous insomnia has resolved since discontinuing the dexamethasone . 
She continues to have an outstanding performance status ( ECOG = 0 ) and is working fulltime . 
Her CBC / ANC remain WNL off GCSF suppport and her LFTs have normalized . 
At this time we will continue the paclitaxel for 2 more cycles tentatively scheduled on 08/18/2013 and 08/25/2013 . 
She does not warrant adjuvant radiation therapy given that she is status post left MRM . 
She plans on completing breast reconstruction surgery 4 weeks after completing chemotherapy . 
We will then start endocrine therapy to decrease her risk of breast cancer recurrence . 
Plan 1 . 
Paclitaxel 80 mg / m2 IV weekly - last 2 doses scheduled for 08/18/2013 qnd 08/25/2013 . 2 . 
Will check CBC prior to next chemotherapy doses 
. 3 . Return to clinic to see me in 4 weeks to evaluate for post - chemotherapy toxicity . 
We will check a CBC and CMP at that time . 
I did spent 30 minutes with the patient in face - to - face contact , with the majority of that time spent in counseling and coordination of care as noted above .
