Discharge Summary DATE OF ADMISSION : 03/24/2017 DATE OF DISCHARGE : 3/30/27 PCP : Jennifer Shen , MD Psychiatry : Michell Levy , MD Oncologist : Mary - Elizabeth Percival , MD DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : Foot pain Chronic pain Irregular menses Pancytopenia AML ( acute myeloid leukemia ) 
Anxiety Adverse effect of drug CONSULTS COMPLETED : Consulting services in CORES : Spiritual Care Neurology Chronic Pain Relief Hematology / Oncology _ OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES : Events / Procedures from CORES : HiDAC consolidaiton # 3 ( d1 & # 61 ; 3 / 24 ) ( 03 - 23 - 2017 ) PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES / RESULTS : CT Head ( 3/26/17 ) 
No acute intracranial abnormalities . 
Specifically no hemorrhage , mass effect or large territorial infarct . 
REASON FOR ADMISSION : 23 year old female with a history of t ( 8 ; 21 ) 
AML admitted for scheduled consolidation chemotherapy under the HiDAC regimen ( 1gm / m2 ) 
HOSPITAL COURSE : 
For h/o AML , per initial recommendations at the time of her diagnosis based on NCCN guidelines , she had been considered for 3 - 4 cycles of consolidative chemotherapy . 
She has since completed 2 cycles of consolidative chemotherapy with G - CLA and High Dose Cytarabine . 
After mutual agreement between herself and Dr Percival to stop consolidative therapy in August of 2016 , she presents now back to the SCCA to request a 3 rd and possibly 4 th cycle of consolidative chemotherapy . 
Ms. Ceesay received a bone marrow biopsy on 3/9/17 which showed no immunophenotypic or morphological evidence of residual acute myeloid leukemia . 
Despite discussion w / Dr Percival of the risks of further chemotherapy compared to the unclear benefit of further consolidation while in remission , she presents now for her 3 rd cycle of consolidation chemotherapy with High Dose Ara - C . 
She received chemotherapy per Dr Percival 's request as follows : Cytarabine 1 , 000 mg / m2 ( 1960 mg ) IV Q12H . 
Infuse over 3 hr . 
Day 1 to 6 , for 12 doses . 
Prednisone 100 mg PO Daily . 
Day 1 to 6 , for 6 doses . 
She received scheduled antiemetic coverage with ondansetron IV and promethazine PO . 
She received PRN antiemetic coverage with offered metoclopramide IV , and Lorazepam PO . 
On D # 2 of chemotherapy , Ms Ceesay experienced word finding difficulty , inability to follow 1 - step commands , intermittent spacticity and clonus of upper and lower extremities . 
Please see below for discussion of that workup . 
We do not believe these events to be related to cytarabine toxicity . 
She will need to start acyclovir , posaconazole and levofloxacin upon d/c for neutropenic prophylaxis . 
She will need to be seen at the SCCA 2 - 3 / weekly for count monitoring and option for transfusion . 
At Dr Percival 's discretion she may receive filgrastim SQ for count support starting ~ D # 14 of this cycle . 
We defer the risk - benefit analysis of a 4 th cycle of consolidative chemotherapy to Dr Percival as an outpatient . 
For vaginal clots and spotting presenting prior to discharge , she feels these are consistent with her menses . 
If worsening or persistent we would recommend increasing her Plt transfusion threshold to 30 k to achieve hemostasis . 
She could also be treated with BID OCP at clinic 's discretion if she continues to spot through nadir . 
No evidence of hemodynamic instability was evidenced during this stay . 
For spacticity and mental status changes on 3/26/17 , Ms Ceesay received CT Head and consultation with inpatient neurology . 
CT Head was unremarkable . 
Neurology exam was largely unremarkable and they did not diagnose cytarabine toxicity at this time . 
Oncology team decreased her dose of promethazine from 25 mg - - > 12 . 
5mg and further limited lorazepam to minimize polypharmacy , deleriogenic medications , and extrapyramidal side effects . 
She continued to experience some intermittent spacticity and " chemo brain " but not to the degree initially witnessed on 3 / 26 for the duration of her hospital stay . 
For pain in her knees , Ms Ceesay was consulted by the Chronic Pain Service d / t her history of difficulty with pain management . 
Upon admission to the hospital she expressed that she feels her pain in the knees , ankles , wrists , and elbows is possibly related to her sickle cell trait or to her AML . 
We discussed that her sickle cell trait is unlikely to cause pain crisis outside of strenuous activity , and that her AML is in remission and would not cause any symptoms at this time . 
CPS agreed to increase her oxycodone dose from 15 mg PO BID to 15 mg PO Q4 hours during this hospitalization only but to resume her outpatient Rx upon discharge . 
She could also resume her MS Contin as prescribed by Dr Shen if she desires , but as she refused it during this hospital stay we have not prescribed it at this time . 
During her hospital stay she requested , at multiple times , the use of IV narcotics despite her expressed efficacy of PO analgesics and her ability to take PO . 
We discussed that IV narcotics are not indicated in this setting . 
No narcotics were prescribed upon discharge and all narcotic prescriptions are to be managed by her outpatient PCP , Dr Shen . 
She has a follow up appointment with Dr Shen at 1530 on 3 / 31 . 
We do not anticipate significant joint pain d / t her history of AML . 
She may experience increased hand and foot pain d / t hand - foot syndrome which we would manage with emolients and topicals as discussed below . 
For her history of sickle cell trait , no Rx or treatment is warranted at this time . 
We do not expect chronic symptoms with sickle cell trait . 
For hand - foot syndrome during this hospital stay , she received prednisone 100 mg PO daily during her hospital stay and received emolients , topical lidocaine gel , topical voltaren , and her existing narcotic regimen . 
As above I discussed with her resuming her MS Contin as previously prescribed . 
No prescription for narcotics were provided . 
For insomnia present prior to admission , she was prescribed trazadone 100 mg PO QHS as recommended by her outpatient psychiatrist Dr Levy . 
She also utilized diphenhydramine and lorazepam for insomnia but these were not added to her regimen as standing medications . 
For her history of depression / PTSD / anxiety , she was continued on escitalopram 30 mg daily per Dr Levy 's recommendation . 
We requested that she speak with inpatient psychiatry to discuss her anxiety which she refused . 
We continued to limit her lorazepam dosing in favor of her SSRI and more directed agents ( i.e. using ondansetron for nausea rather than lorazepam IV ) . 
We encouraged her to continue working closely w / Dr Levy to manage her anxiety . 
During her hospital stay , Ms Ceesay exhibited significant adverse and oppositional behaviors which impacted her care team 's ability to provide care . 
Upon arrival at UWMC she immediately requested IV promethazine , IV diphenhydramine , increased short acting narcotic RX and discontinuation of long acting narcotics , and IV lorazepam . 
We discussed that there were no indications for these interventions at this time and discussed the risks of IV medications vs PO and the lack of rationale for increasing narcotics in absence of new complication when she has been managed very adequately by her outpatient PCP . 
She requested IV narcotics multiple times during hospitalization despite not fully utilizing her PO regimen . 
On 3 / 25 she told staff that she wanted to leave the hospital because she did not like how she was being treated , including that she felt she was dexcriminated against for her gender and race , and felt that her symptoms could not be controlled by medications we were willing to prescribe . 
On 3 / 26 with onset of altered mental status and spacticity , when examined by this author , she grew angry when we discussed decreasing medications to determine if polypharmacy was contributing to her symptoms . 
She immediately told this author that we " can ' t " change her narcotic Rx ( though narcotic changes had not been suggested ) and that she would not report any new side effects or answer questions from her care team ( seemingly so that we would not consider chemo toxicity as a reason to hold cytarabine therapy ) . 
Given our inability to properly assess toxicity and administer therapy safely , we obtained imaging and neurology consult at this time as above and ultimately moved forward with additional cytarabine in absence of evidence of toxicity . 
We discussed that she needs to be an active participant in her care in order to receive therapy safely . 
On 3 / 28 she again threatened staff to leave prior to completion of chemotherapy and refused her prophylactic prednisolone gtt . 
Again our staff , Andy Lin ARNP , discussed that we can not provide chemotherapy if she is not compliant with recommended and required adjuvant medications . 
Myself and ARNP Lin both discussed w / Ms Ceesay that since she had remaining oxycodone from prior to admission that we would not prescribe additional narcotics and that she would follow up with her PCP Dr Shen on 3 / 31 and we both discussed that she would need to resume her home narcotic dosing on discharge . 
On the day of discharge she told this author that ARNP Lin had told her he would write for additional narcotics and that we had agreed to increase her to Q4 hour oxycodone through the duration of her nadir ; both things which we have been clear about not prescribing throughout her hospital stay . 
Please see note from Holly Venugopal , PA with Chronic Pain Service which discusses that Ms. Ceesay was last prescribed a 7 day Rx of oxycodone on 3 / 20 ( 4 days prior to admission ) which is in contrast to her report to me this AM that she has no narcotics at home . 
At the discretion of her PCP , she could be weened down from Q4 hour oxycodone back to her home dosing over a 3 - 4 day perior per PA Venugopal 's last note on 3 / 28 but this taper is not strictly necessary medically . 
On the day of discharge she remains anxious about potential discharge but does describe a desire to go home . 
She is eating , drinking , but largely remains in bed . 
She was seen by PT which prescribed a FWW to offload weight bearing while experiencing hand - foot syndrome . 
They recommend home discharge with intermittent family assistance . 
On the day of discharge she was notified to anticipate discharge ~ 1300 and agreed , later requesting we delay discharge until 1700 and then again until 2100 as her ride was delayed . 
MSW was able to coordinate assistive transportation under her insurance benefit and she agreed to d/c at 1630 .
