Hospital Course & Reason for Admission 
IDENTIFYING DATA Mr. Griffith is a 53 - year - old male currently diagnosed with relapsed secondary AML . 
He was first diagnosed with marginal zone lymphoma involving lungs in August 2003 , and achieved stable complete remission of his lymphoproliferative disease in December 2004 . 
A secondary leukemia from chemotherapy toxicity was documented in June 2004 . 
He received induction therapy with IA3x7 and two courses with high - dose Ara - C as consolidation . 
The patient was planned to undergo a myeloablative MRD PBSCT then , but was found to be in relapse of his AML during pretransplant studies . 
He was admitted on 11/07/09 to salvage G - CLAC chemotherapy . 
PROBLEM LIST PROBLEM # 1 . 
PROTOCOLS Patient received G - CLAC chemotherapy based on Fred Hutchinson protocol 6562 PROBLEM # 2 . 
CHEMOTHERAPY CYCLE 
Mr. Griffith received G - CSF 5 mcg/Kg daily starting on November 6 , Clofarabine 25mg / m2 daily from 11 / 07 through 11/11/09 and Cytarabine 2gm / m2 daily from 11 / 07 through 11 / 11 . 
He tolerated the treatment without major complications during the days of infusion . 
He didn�t report nausea or vomiting . 
Tumor lysis syndrome was well controlled with alkaline hydration and Allopurinol . 
Related to IV fluids , Mr. Griffith showed bilateral edemas in his lower extremities , solved just with reduction in the delivery rate during the last two days of admission . 
Once he had finished his chemotherapy course , during the last night of admission , Mr. Wade show an episode of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( see below ) . 
PROBLEM # 3 . 
HEMATOLOGICAL As expected , his CBC counts dropped throghout his admission . 
At the time of his discharge , they were : WBC counts 0 / mcL . 
Hematocrit 27 % . 
Platelets counts 9x10 
( 3 ) / mcL . 
Mr. Griffith received RBC transfusions on November 9 , 10 and 11 , 2009 , 2 units daily for hematocrit below 26 % . 
Additionally , he needed platelets transfusions on November 9 , 11 and 12 , 2009 for platelets counts below 10 , 000 / mcL . 
The patient showed reaction to RBC transfusion on November 10 and 11 despite premedication with diphenhydramine 25 mg and acetaminophen 650 mg , with rigors without fever , shortness of breath or skin rash . 
He got good relief with additional dose of diphenhydramine . 
PROBLEM # 4 . 
INFECTIOUS DISEASES 
In mid - October , Mr. Griffith complained of dry cough and runny nose and was found to have H1N1 Influenza A by PCR testing from nasal wash . 
He started on oseltamivir . 
Subsequent repeat nasal washes , latest prior to admission on 11/04/09 , showed persistent shedding of H1N1 Influenza A . 
The patient stated clinical improvement of his upper respiratory infection , though . 
In view of this and since his titers were low , the patient was seen and cleared by the infectious disease team . 
He had completed his course of oseltamivir and was asymptomatic at the time of his admission . 
He neither complained of any respiratory symptoms nor showed signs of hypoxemia during this interim and the surveillance chest X - ray performed didn�t show signs for pneumonia . 
He continued on famciclovir prophylaxis . 
No other infectious issues during this interim . 
On Fluconazol and Levofloxacine prophylaxis . 
PROBLEM # 5 . 
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION Mr. Griffith showed a brief episode of atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response once he had finished his chemotherapy cycle , in the night of November 11 , 2009 . 
He only complained of palpitations , without chest pain , shortness of breath , fever or chills , numbness or tingling . 
The episode was documented by EKG , lasted about 45 minutes , and terminated back to normal sinus rhythm after a first dose of Metoprolol . 
Mr. Griffith had no previous history of cardiac issues . 
The cardiac enzymes studies came back negative ( CK - MB mass 1ng / mL ; Troponin - I 0.0 1ng / mL ) . 
The echocardiography performed on 11/12/09 showed normal cardiac function and no structural heart disease . 
A Cardiology consult was requested . 
Cardilogy considered that Mr. Griffith�s risk of thromboembolic stroke was extremely low ( less than 2 % ) given the episode characteristics , the current thrombocytopenia and lack of other risk factors , and that there was no need of anticoagulation including aspirin . 
The episode was likely related to volume overload and anxiety . 
The patient remained in normal sinus rhythm at the time of his discharge . 
He was to be continue on Metoprolol and clinical surveillance . 
History and Physical DISEASE STATUS : 
His HPI is well - documented in ORCA , most notably by Paul Martin on August 31 , 2009 , Sarah Lill , PA - C , on October 20 , 2009 , and discharge summary by Michael Wiggins on October 26 , 2009 . 
Briefly , Mr. Griffith was diagnosed with a marginal zone lymphoma involving lungs in August 2003 . 
He was treated initially with R - CHOP for 3 cycles , followed by RICE for 3 cycles . 
Additional therapy included Cytoxan , etoposide , dexamethasone for the chemomobilization . 
He received 6 cycles of fludarabine and Rituxan followed by maintenance Rituxan in June 2005 through December 2005 . 
He also received Zevalin December 2004 . 
With regards to his lymphoma , he has been in remission since his Zevalin therapy . 
In June 2004 he was diagnosed with AML after presenting with fatigue and bruising . 
His bone marrow at the time showed 40 % blasts with FISH studies being negative for FLIT3 . 
He was treated with induction idarubicin and ara - C which got him into remission . 
This was followed by 2 cycles of high - dose ara - C for consolidation . 
High - dose ara - C was complicated by pneumonia requiring hospitalization . 
He arrived in mid - October at the SCCA for pretransplant evaluation but on arrival was found to have fevers and an upper respiratory tract infection . 
He was admitted to the University of Washington for further management and was subsequently found to H1N1 influenza A by PCR testing . 
He was treated with oseltamivir . 
He has had subsequent repeat nasal washes , most recently on November 4 , 2009 , which show persistent shedding of H1N1 influenza A . 
Per the patient , he is significantly improved , as presently he has a minimal cough and occasional nasal drainage but no persistent fevers or shortness of breath . 
Unfortunately he was also found to be in relapse with a bone marrow on October 30 , 2009 , showing an abnormal myeloblast population of 4.5 % in the peripheral blood and 9.4 in the bone marrow . 
Flow cytometry cells abnormally depressed CD4 , CD13 , CD34 , CD123 . 
Additionally he was found to have a second population of immature monocytes . 
By morphology the immature monocytic cells both of blasts and promyelocytes comprised 80 % of cells . 
Cytogenetics showed a normal male karyotype . 
The patient has been maintained on Hydrea with a white blood count as of today was ith 39.51 , with 0.99 blasts . 
He is being admitted today for GCLAC based on Fred Hutchinson protocol 6562 . 
He received his priming G - CSF in the clinic yesterday and will receive his clofarabine and ara - C today on admission .
