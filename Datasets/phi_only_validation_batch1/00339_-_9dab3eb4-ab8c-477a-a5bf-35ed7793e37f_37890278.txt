IMAGING
Fluoro guided LP yesterday :
After discussing the risks and benefits of the procedure , an informed consent was obtained from the patient . Following this , a time-out was performed verifying the patient 's name , date of birth and procedure type . The patient was placed prone on the fluoroscopy table . The L3 - L4 interlaminar space was marked under fluoroscopy . The area was prepped and draped in sterile fashion . 1 percent lidocaine was injected . A 5 inch 22 gauge spinal needle was advanced into the thecal sac with return of CSF . 9 cc of CSF were collected and sent for lab studies . Following this , 100 milligrams in 2 milliliters of cytarabine was administered intrathecally . The stylet was replaced and the needle was removed . The patient tolerated the procedure well .

EEG 10 / 10
IMPRESSION : Normal EEG in the awake , drowsy , and asleep states


ASSESSMENT & PLAN
Ms. Ball is a 24 yo F with AML , history of neutropenic fever and seizures admitted for second cycle of CLAG consolidation chemotherapy .

# . Acute myelogenous leukemia : Consolidation chemotherapy Day 4 ( D1 = 10 / 8 ) with CLAG s/p filgrastim priming . Pt is FLT3 + and has translocation of 6 ; 11 and deletion of 9 . Pt not neutropenic , however did have a drop in WBC from 14 to 5.5 today . TLS and DIC labs remain unremarkable . Now s/p LP that was unremarkable by flow for malignancy . She was given IT cytarabine . Will need to monitor closely for worsening cognitive fxn with concerns for cytarabine toxicity .
- CLAG : Filgrastim subcutaneously days 0-5 , cladribine days 1-5 , and cytarabine IV days 1-5 ( 25 % reduction ) .
- Prophylaxis : Allopurinol 300 mg qD , acyclovir 800 mg BID , Posaconazole 200 mg TID , Levaquin 750 mg qHS - > switched to ceftaz 10 / 10 .
- Antiemetics per powerplan + scopolamine patch
- TLS labs qD , DIC labs tonight
- IVF per powerplan
- Transfusion thresholds plt 10 , hct 26
- PRBCs : 10 / 11

# . SIRS physiology : Meets criteria with fever , tachycardia and tachypnea . Pt fevered ystd after transfusion but remained febrile after . Not endorsing any localizing sx . UA was negative ystd . No SOB or cough , unlikely a CXR would reveal any new pathology . It 's possible she had a non hemolytic transfusion rxn , however her fever didn 't arise until after the transfusion finished and continued to fever after . Another possible etiology is reaction to chemotherapy , her fever occured post-LP with IT chemo . Also possible is sinusitis or infectious meningitis , although the later is very unlikely and pt 's CSF was negative for infection .
- ceftazadime for broad coverage as anticipation pt will be come neutropenic .
- Tylenol PRN HA and fever

# . Headache : Ddx includes migraine , tension HA , side efx from medications ( GCSF , cytarabine ) and / or side efx from LP . pt with intermittent headaches on admission , then worsened after LP . frontal in origin . do not want to use NSAIDs as pt on chemo and will drop her counts . Pt not refractory to HA tx yet , therefore will hold off on blood patch and pt is a difficult LP given her body habitus .
- f/u with neuro if they have any recs on additional HA / migraine treatment .
- gabapentin
- caffeine 100 mg q6hr
- oxycodone
- tylenol

# . Seizures : EEG normal , however this doesn 't completely rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy . Neurology saw pt and given her mother 's description of events , it 's likely pt has been experiencing seizures . As far as why they presented themselves with chemotherapy tx and not for the last several years is unknown .
- Neurology following , appreciate recs
- Keppra 1500 mg q12hr ( if nauseated convert keppra to IV ; same dose )
- Ativan if seizure > 2 min

STABLE / RESOLVED ISSUES :
# Low back pain and weakness : Improved . pt has long hx and sounds like worsens with intense mood and deconditioning . Has some elements of neuropathic involvement with shooting sensation down bil legs to mid thigh area . She has hx of " slipped discs " , reports not having any prior back / spine imaging . Pt is morbidly obese as well as markedly deconditioned for a woman of her age . Her weakness can be further worsening her LBP . As far as etiology of weakness , seems to have started around when AML was diagnosed , now using a walker or wheelchair and with slow gait , doesn 't appear to have ataxic gait . Again concern for chemo toxicity , but also could be severe deconditioning from severe illness induced myopathy when pt in ICU in September 2014 .
- gabapentin 300 mg qHS
- PT/OT

# . Memory deficits : Unclear etiology at this time . Ddx includes iatrogenic / toxic from medications , possible post-ictal state as well as PTSD . Most likely this is a chemotherapy side effect , and hope memory clears with time . Further evaluation of seizures as above , but keppra can also cause a sedation - like state , although mild , which could contribute . Pt does not have hx of PTSD , but this is also known to cause memory deficits .
- CTM

# . Diarrhea : likely chemo related or IBS as pt having difficulties with anxiety and mood lately . C diff negative 10 / 09 .
- Loperamide prn

# . Adjustment disorder with anxiety : pt followed by psychologist as outpt . Diagnosed after AML .
- Sertraline
