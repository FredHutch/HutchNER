UNDERLYING ONCOLOGIC DISEASE / CONDITION / DESCRIPTION :
James Lee is a 28 year old male with relapsed AML , one year s/p haploidentical transplant on 4/15/2015 ( CMV donor - / recipient + ) with most recent chemotherapy including etoposide / cytarabine on 4 / 28 . He is well-known to Infectious Disease . Please review most recent notes dated 5 / 5-5 / 6 / 2016 .

In summary , he was diagnosed in 2014 with AML , received 7 + 3 induction chemotherapy , but was found to have 28 % blasts by bone marrow aspirate . He then underwent reinduction with G - CLAM on 2/10/2015 which was complicated by a Streptococcus bacteremia . He did achieve a complete remission . He then underwent consolidation on 3/23/2015 with G - CLA , complicated by a Staphylococcus bacteremia . He proceeded to his transplant but was found to have relapsed so began Vidaza in 8 / 2015 . He went on to receive cytarabine / daunorubicin / bortezumib . In 11 / 2015 , he was found to have GI GVHD by biopsy after experiencing nausea and was treated with a short course of prednisone through February . He is now on topical steroids .

He went on to receive multiple chemotherapies including romidepsin ( 11/13/2015 ) , cytarabine ( 12/4/2015 ) , decitabine / mec ( 12/7/2015 ) which was complicated by a peri-rectal abscess , C.diff , enterobacter septicemia , and chemotherapy toxicity with an ejection fraction of 23 % . He then proceeded to decitabin / olaparib ( 3 / 2016 ) , followed by C2 / decitabine ( 4 / 2016 ) , C2 etoposide with cytarabine ( 4 / 2016 ) . He was hospitalized during this course of chemotherapy with recurrent fevers , source not identified despite thorough infectious disease work - up . CMV , EBV were negative though HHV6 came back at 60 . Recheck one week later was 0 . He rapidly defervesced on ertapenem and levofloxacin and was ultimately treated for a 14 day course ( 5 / 3-5/21 ) . He was discharged on prophylactic levofloxacin , valacyclovir , and dapsone . In the outpatient clinic , posaconazole was discontinued due to elevated LFTs . He had been neutropenic since ~ 3 / 2016 though his cells are returning .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
James was admitted on 6 / 4 after feeling poorly for the past 2-3 days at home . He describes low-grade fevers at home , but on 6 / 3 , he measured a fever of 101.5 . He called the SCCA and was told to go to ED . At ED he was afebrile , but tachycardic and hypotensive . He was admitted and given ceftazidime with daptomycin in the ED . On the floor , he was switched to cefepime , then returned to ceftazidime on 6 / 6 .

Today , he describes he is feeling okay though has nausea associated with his fevers . During his nausea , he has rhinorrhea and coughing , but only during his nausea episode . He denies any pre-existing URI , any URI symptoms currently including rhinorrhea , sore throat , congestion . He does note tachycardia that during his fevers , is uncomfortable .

RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES : ( personally reviewed with radiology )
Chest x - ray : 6 / 4
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION :

Worsening right lower lung consolidation could represent infection or atelectasis / aspiration . Otherwise no focal consolidation .

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax .

Heart and mediastinum are unchanged . Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC .

CT Chest : 6 / 4
FINDINGS AND IMPRESSION :

Worsening right lower lung consolidation could represent infection or atelectasis / aspiration . Otherwise no focal consolidation .

No pleural effusion or pneumothorax .

Heart and mediastinum are unchanged . Right IJ central venous catheter terminates in the lower SVC .

PROBLEMS / ASSESSMENT / PLAN :
28 year old male with relapsed AML , s/p allogeneic transplant on 5/15/2015 with most recent chemotherapy of etoposide / cytarabine on 4 / 28 , admitted for now non - neutropenic fevers . He 's been neutropenic since ~ 3 / 2016 but recently counts have returned . He is now non - neutropenic with chest CT suggestive of peri - vascular ground glass opacities , which are less suggestive of a fungal infection and more suggestive of a viral or atypical pneumonia . He does not have frank URI symptoms , but does describe rhinorrhea and cough during his nausea episodes . We would recommend an NPT . Consider stopping his broad spectrum antibiotics and instead , start azithromycin for an atypical pneumonia . Stop posaconazole as patient does not need anti-fungal prophylaxis given his returned counts . If he does receive neutropenia inducing chemotherapy that will keep his counts low , consider restarting posaconazole at that time .

RECOMMENDATIONS :
1 . Stop ceftazidime .
2 . Start azithromycin , 500 mg daily x3 days .
3 . Obtain NPT .
4 . Continue to monitor fever curve .
5 . Plan to rescan in 4-6 weeks or prior to next round of chemotherapy or treatment .

Recommendations discussed with Primary Team ( x ) . Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the patient 's care . Please call with any questions .
