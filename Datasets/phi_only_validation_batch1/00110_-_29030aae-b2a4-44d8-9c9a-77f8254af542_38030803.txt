HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms. Ryan presented in October 2013 with progressive fatigue , weight loss , and Strep pharyngitis which prompted a comprehensive evaluation that revealed leukocytosis , anemia , thrombocytopenia , and 12 % circulating blasts . A diagnostic bone marrow evaluation demonstrated a hypercellular marrow with 75 % blasts by morphology , normal cytogenetics , and FLT3 and NPM1 positivity . Ms. Ryan proceeded to receive her first induction chemotherapy cycle with 7 + 3 Cytarabine and Daunorubicin that was complicated by neutropenic fever of unknown origin and resolved following a course of empiric Meropenem . A restaging bone marrow evaluation on November 4 , 2013 showed minimal residual disease by morphology and 1 % abnormal myeloid blasts by flow cytometry . Molecular studies were revealing for FLT3 and NPM1 negativity , and cytogenetic testing was not repeated . Following a transfer of care to Dr. Eli Estey in November 2014 , she completed a second induction cycle of 7 +3 Cytarabine and Idarubicin which was complicated by sepsis , NSTEMI , and uterine bleeding . Her restaging bone marrow evaluation on December 18 , 2013 demonstrated no evidence of disease by morphology and flow cytometry . She proceeded to receive consolidation treatment with high-dose Cytarabine on January 7 , 2014 which was complicated by appendicitis requiring an appendectomy on January 24 , 2014 and presumptive fungal pneumonia based on reviewed results of a bronchoscopy performed at an outside facility on January 29 , 2014 . Ms. Ryan presented to the Allogeneic Transplant Service Red Team on February 4 , 2014 for evaluation and consideration of a myeloablative , HLA - matched , ABO mismatched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell transplant to consolidate her disease remission .
HEMATOPOEITIC TRANSPLANT HISTORY
DISEASE : AML , FLT 3 / NPM1 positive in CR - 1 at time of transplant .
DATE OF TRANSPLANT : February 27 , 2014 .
PREPARATIVE REGIMEN : Reduced intensity conditioning according to Protocol 2497 - Fludarabine 30 mg / m2 / dose for a total dose of 245 mg given over 5 days between February 21 through 25 , 2014 , followed by intravenous Busulfan 3.2 mg / kg / dose for a total dose of 382 mg given over 2 days between February 22 through 23 , 2014 .
TRANSPLANT TYPE : Peripheral blood stem cells from a HLA - matched , ABO mismatched unrelated female donor . The total stem cell product infused was 11.28 x 106 CD34 cells / kg .
ENGRAFTMENT : Ms. Ryan started to engraft on day 14 , March 13 , 2014 , and achieved a sustained engraftment with an ANC > 500 for 3 consecutive days on day 21 , March 21 , 2014 .
ACUTE GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Tacrolimus and Methotrexate .
BLOOD TYPING : Ms. Ryan was ABO type O - negative and her donor was A-positive pre - transplant .
CMV STATUS : Ms. Ryan was CMV seropositive and her donor was CMV seronegative at the time of
her transplant .

POST-TRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS
Ms. Ryan required frequent hospitalizations to evaluate and manage multiple complications throughout her post-transplant course including :
1 .
AML Relapse . Ms. Ryan had an early relapse of her FLT3 + AML detected on a routine CBD on day 57 , May 15 , 2014 revealing a rapid rise in her leukocyte count to 28 , 000 and 18 % circulating blasts . She was deemed ineligible to receive salvage therapy by Dr. Eli Estey due to risk for exacerbating her pre-existing GI GVHD . Hydroxurea 1 gram PO BID was started with Allopurinol on May 15 , 2014 , however due to a rapid rise in her leukocyte count from 20 , 000 to 68 , 000 on May 17 , 2014 , Ms. Ryan’s Hydroxyurea was increased to 2 grams BID which she continued through May 27 , 2014 when she became pancytopenic . Sorafenib 400 mg PO BID was added on May 25 , 2014 to optimize her disease control and was discontinued on July 21 , 2014 due to elevated liver function tests of a multifactorial etiology including salvage G - CLAM given between July 2 through July 6 , 2014 , polypharmacy effect , and sepsis . Ms. Ryan’s restaging bone marrow evaluation following a month of Sorafenib therapy on June 26 , 2014 was revealing for 2.6 % abnormal myeloid blasts by flow cytometry and a normal female karyotype without cytogenetic evidence of AML .
She proceeded to receive one cycle of salvage G - CLAM between July 2 through July 7 , 2014 and
had repeat bone marrow evaluations on July 31 , 2014 and more recently on October 16 , 2014
that demonstrated a sustained complete remission based on morphology , flow cytometry , and
cytogenetic analyses .

2 .
VRE Bacteremia / Sepsis . Ms. Ryan required admission to the inpatient BMT service on July 10 , 2014 following a neutropenic fever of 38.6 on day 10 following her G - CLAM salvage therapy . The source of her fever was identified as a VRE bacteremia detected on a July 18 , 2014 blood culture . She defervesced rapidly on Ceftazidime and then developed recurrent fever with sepsis physiology based on a systolic blood pressure of 96 . Repeat blood cultures detected VRE bacteremia which prompted the transition to a 14 day course of Daptomycin and a change from Meropenem to Aztreonam based on the recommendation of the Infectious Disease for suspected Meropenem precipitated fevers . Ms. Ryan’s fevers resolved with engraftment and she was discharged with stable hemodynamics and sterile blood cultures on July 29 , 2014 .

3 .
Graft - versus - host disease .
A .
Gastrointestinal . Ms. Ryan was admitted to the inpatient BMT service on May 1 , 2014 to
evaluate loss of consciousness in the setting of recent large volume diarrhea , early satiety ,
nausea , and vomiting that had persisted for one week . An inpatient GI consultation was
requested to evaluate the etiology of her symptoms via an endoscopic biopsy performed on
May 2 , 2014 which confirmed mild to moderate GVHD involving the duodenum , stomach ,
and colon . Ms. Ryan’s initial therapy included continued Tacrolimus with a target trough of
5-15 ng / mL and start of Beclomethasone , Budesonide , and 0.5 mg/kg of Prednisone started
May 4 , 2014 with a taper initiated on May 10 , 2014 . Due to progressive symptoms , Ms. Ryan’s
Prednisone dose was increased to 1 mg/kg on May 14 , 2014 . Her symptom relief remained
marginal and ultimately progressed to severe bloating and recurrent diarrhea with abdominal
cramping following 2 weeks of therapy that prompted a repeat endoscopic evaluation on
May 19 , 2014 that was revealing for a bezoar and focal gastritis without evidence of H . Pylori
or a viral etiology of her symptoms , and pathological findings of progressive duodenum ,
sigmoid colon , and rectal GVHD , and unchanged antrum GVHD . Due to active relapsed AML
detected on May 15 , 2014 , a Prednisone dose taper of 10 % every 3 days was initiated on May
23 , 2014 throughJune 22 , 2014 to promote a GVL effect . Ms. Ryan was initially evaluated by
the LTFU service on July 7 , 2014 for GVHD manifestations and treatment recommendations
that prompted the discontinuation of Tacrolimus as she was pancytopenic following salvage
G - CLAM and no GVHD findings were detected . Her Prednisone taper was held at 20 mg
daily in anticipation of a GVHD flare with recovering marrow function and rebounding
lymphocyte circulation . Prednisone was dose increased to 1 mg/kg , Beclomethasone was
increased to 2 mg PO QID , Budensonide was increased to 3 mg PO QID , and Tacrolimus was
restarted on August 21 , 2014 following a flare of severe GI distress including nausea ,
abdominal cramping , and watery diarrhea that persisted and prompted her admission to the
inpatient BMT service on August 28 , 2014 for further evaluation and management . An
endoscopic evaluation on August 26 , 2014 was revealing for moderate stomach and
duodenum GVHD and severe rectum GVHD . She was treated with an escalated
corticosteroid dose of 2 mg/kg of Methylprednisolone , intravenous antiemetics and analgesia ,
and bowel rest .

B .
Liver . Ms. Ryan had pre-existing elevated liver function tests including hyperbilirubinemia that peaked to 8.8 on August 25 , 2014 with accompanying diffuse abdominal tenderness , acholic diarrhea , abdominal bloating , and nausea . A liver ultrasound performed on August 25 , 2014 was revealing for choleithiasis without cholecystitis , a fatty 2.8 cm infiltration and no evidence of veno - occlusive disease . A core needle biopsy was obtained on August 28 , 2014 following her admission to the inpatient BMT service on August 25 , 2014 for progressive symptoms and low grade fever and showed bile duct injury , loss of multiple portal tracts , and cholestasis deemed consistent with liver GVHD in addition to findings of macrovesicular steatosis with origins of possible drug reaction , obesity , or alcoholic liver disease . All viral cultures including CMV and adenovirus were negative for an infectious source of her elevated liver function parameters and progressive GI distress . Given her presenting symptoms and these findings , Ms. Ryan was treated with 2 mg/kg of Methylprednisolone , intravenous antiemetics , bowel rest , and continued elimination of hepatotoxic polypharmacy which had been initiated prior to her admission on recommendation by the outpatient GI service following a consultation on August 4 , 2014 .


C .
Skin . Ms. Ryan developed a new onset of rash along her scalp , face , neck , chest , abdomen ,
and back during a Prednisone taper on June 19 , 2014 which was held at 30 mg to treat the
presumed skin GVHD . In addition to corticosteroid treatment , Ms. Ryan used
Triamcinolone ointment and Benadryl which resulted in significant improvement after
July 1 , 2014 with a documented resolution on July 17 , 2014 . She developed a
recurrent bilateral follicular axillary rash that represented biopsy proven chronic
GVHD and likely chemotherapy toxicity . The folliculitis flare resolved following a
course of antibiotic ointment and continuation of Prednisone held at a 20 mg daily
dose between July 7 through August 21 , 2014 when she had a flare of severe GI
symptoms and dramatically rising liver function parameters .

4 .
Platelet transfusion reaction . Ms. Ryan developed a cough , mild throat edema without airway
compromise , a rash and generalized edema on July 29 , 2014 during a platelet transfusion . Her
symptoms resolved following a dose of IV Benadryl . Since her transfusion reaction , Ms. Ryan has
required Benadryl in addition to Tylenol and Loratadine as pre - medications for all platelet
transfusions .

5 .
Gastroparesis vs . Dysmotility . Ms. Ryan presented with intractable spastic abdominal pain
that prompted her admission to the inpatient BMT service between May 21 through
May 29 , 2014 . A CT of the abdomen was revealing for moderate gastric distention without
obstruction and a distended colon filled with stool or possible bezoar . Her symptoms
resolved following bowel rest with NG tube decompression , a low fiber diet , a brief course
of Metoclopromide , intravenous Hydromorphone , Methylprednisolone , and TPN . It is
likely that her symptomology was of multifactorial etiology including exacerbation of
graft-versus-host disease , narcotic sequela , and polypharmacy effects .

6 .
Mucositis . Ms. Ryan required a brief inpatient admission between March 8 through
March 11 , 2014 to manage grade 3 mucositis that manifested as severe odynophagia and
general oral cavity discomfort that precluded compliance with her oral medication
regimen . Her symptoms resolved following a transition to intravenous medications and
Hydromorphone for pain management during her inpatient course .

7 .
Nausea / Vomiting . Ms. Ryan required an early post-transplant admission to the inpatient BMT service between March 8 through March 11 , 2014 to manage nausea and vomiting that flared throughout her post-transplant course due to waxing and waning GI GVHD as above detailed in the Graft-versus-host disease section . Her symptoms abated with scheduled Zofran and PRN Compazine and Ativan that she continued through late August 2014 .

8 .
Liver Injury : Ms. Ryan developed elevated liver function tests on July 14 , 2014 that included an
an elevated total bilirubin of 1.5 with direct bilirubin of 0.5 and normal transaminase and
alkaline phosphatase levels . She had a further increased total bilirubin up to 1.8 with 0.9
direct bilirubin and mild transaminitis on July 20 , 2014 that progressed on July 23 , 2014
and July 27 , 2014 with the latter hepatic function panel date showing a newly elevated
alkaline phosphatase . The trajectory of her levels waxed and waned which prompted a liver
ultrasound without a doppler evaluation on August 5 , 2014 that was revealing for
increased echogenicity and cholelithiasis without biliary dilatation or choledocholithiasis .
The GI service was consulted to guide further workup and consider the etiology of
Ms. Ryan’s altered liver function tests which was suspected to represent NASH , atypical
GVHD , or polypharmacy toxicity .

9 .
Syncope . Ms. Ryan was admitted to the inpatient BMT service on May 1 , 2014 to evaluate a loss of consciousness that was ultimately attributed to volume depletion following a week of diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting . Imaging including head CT and brain MRI were obtained during this admission period and were unrevealing for intracranial hemorrhage , pathology , or PRES . Ms. Ryan was deemed stable for discharge on May 3 , 2014 by the Neurology service and has not had recurrent syncope or other neurological events during her post-transplant course .

10 .
Vaginal Bleeding . Ms. Ryan reported persistent vaginal bleeding in the setting of pancytopenia and first post-transplant sexual intercourse in May 2014 that prompted her presentation to the UWMC 8 NE triage clinic where she received platelets and a red blood cell transfusion . She was evaluated by Mary Schubert on June 18 , 2014 who recommended an ultrasound that showed a normal endometrium . Ms. Ryan’s bleeding ultimately resolved following a transition from Sprintec and Estradiol to 2 doses of Premarin and Megace PO TID .

11 .
Constipation . Ms. Ryan required Metoclopramide and and self - disimpaction to resolve her post-transplant constipation that lingered following her inpatient admission in late May 2014 to manage gastroparesis .

12 .
Hypertension . Ms. Ryan’s hypertension correlated to concomitant calcineurin inhibitor use and normalized on Carvedilol and Amlodipine during her early post-transplant course .

13 .
Arthralgias / Myalgias . Ms. Ryan had right hip pain , suspected to be sequela from a bone marrow biopsy , with progression throughout her knees , elbows and feet in late February and early March 2014 following her conditioning and stem cell transplant that eventually resolved with Hydromorphone and Topical Lidocaine .

14 .
Steroid induced hyperglycemia . Ms. Ryan has required exogenous insulin therapy with frequent insulin regimen modifications and close surveillance by the endocrinology and dietary services since starting corticosteroid therapy on May 4 , 2014 to manage her numerous GVHD flares .

15 .
Anxiety / Depression . Ms. Ryan has a history of anxiety and depression that persisted during her post-transplant course with exacerbations correlated to corticosteroid therapy for GVHD . She declined interest in social work , psychology , or psychiatry consults for supportive counseling and psychosocial evaluations to determine her need for antidepressant and / or anxiolytic therapies .

16 .
Hypomagnesemia . Ms. Ryan’s persistent hypomagnesemia is secondary to Tacrolimus which has normalized with intravenous supplementation since her stem cell transplant .

17 .
Hypokalemia . Ms. Ryan’s persistent hypokalemia is secondary to decreased intake and absorption . Her levels normalized with intravenous potassium supplementation throughout her post-transplant course .

MS. RYAN’S BMT DISCHARGE LTFU GVHD EVALUATION WILL BE PERFORMED ON 10/22/2014 .
ACTIVE PROBLEM LIST
1 . AML , FLT3 / NPM1 + in CR - 2 . Ms. Ryan resumed Sorafenib 400 mg PO every day on October 9 , 2014 following a 6 week drug holiday due to progressive transaminitis and elevated liver function tests attributed to hepatotoxic polypharmacy and her G - CLAM salvage therapy administered between July 2 through July 6 , 2014 . She has achieved a sustained complete disease remission based on her most recent bone marrow evaluation on October 16 , 2014 that showed no evidence of abnormal myeloid blasts by morphology , flow cytometry , or cytogenetics . She will continue Sorafenib with a dosing adjustment to 200 mg PO every 12 hours effective today , October 21 , 2014 to limit hepatoxicity .
2 . GRAFT - VERSUS - HOST DISEASE . Ms. Ryan’s recent graft vs . host disease flare involved the upper and lower GI as well as the liver and required inpatient evaluation and management between August 25 through September 6 , 2014 . Her total bilirubin peaked to 10 during this interim and has normalized to 0.7 as of today’s lab results ; the remainder of her liver function tests have been stable since holding her Prednisone taper dose at 50 mg on October 2 , 2014 . Moreover , Ms. Ryan’s gastrointestinal symptoms have remained well controlled throughout the scheduled Prednisone taper since her hospital discharge based on a schedule of 1.5 mg kg daily between September 3 through September 9 , 2014 , 1 mg/kg daily between September 10 through September 21 , 2014 , followed by a 10 mg dose reduction every 5 dayys that has been held at 50 gm daily since October 2 , 2014 due to elevated liver function . Ms. Ryan will be evaluated by the LTFU service tomorrow , October 22 , 2014 to determine an appropriate schedule and timing to resume a corticosteroid dose taper . Dr. Mary Flowers of the LTFU service recommended that Ms. Ryan have documented stable liver function on Sorafenib for 2 weeks prior to initiating the corticosteroid taper in order to reliably assess the Sorafenib effect on her liver function parameters .

3 . INFECTION :
a . Bacterial . No active infections . Ms. Ryan is VRE colonized and requires contact enteric precaution
isolation for all clinical encounters at the UWMC or SCCA . She has received weekly Pentamidine for
PJP prophylaxis secondary to avoidance of hepatotoxic and GI distress with Bactrim and past
methemoglobinemia with Dapsone . Her most recent Pentamidine dose was administered
intravenously today , October 21 , 2014 due to an intolerance for the inhaled route given in
September 2014 . Her weekly surveillance bacterial blood cultures remain sterile to date since she
started corticosteroid therapy in May 2014 .
b . Fungal . No active infections . Ms. Ryan alternated between posaconazole and Micafungin for
antifungal coverage throughout her post-transplant course due to poor Posaconazole absorption
in the setting of GI GVHD and to limit hepatotoxic effects of Micafungin during her protracted
elevated liver function that evolved in July 2014 with subsequent biopsy proven liver GVHD in
August 2014 . She recently completed a course of prophylactic Micafungin between August 29 , 2014
through October 15 , 2014 following a surveillance chest CT that confirmed complete resolution of
her pulmonary nodules , attributed to Aspergillus Pneumonia detected on a January 29 , 2014
bronchoscopy following consolidation with high dose Cytarabine . Her weekly surveillance fungal
blood cultures remain sterile to date since she started corticosteroid therapy in May 2014 .
c . Viral . No active infections . Ms. Ryan is CMV seropositive with a CMV seronegative donor .
Her surveillance CMV PCR assays have been assessed weekly since day 0 and remain negative to
Date with the most recent PCR surveillance today , October 21 , 2014 . During her post-transplant
course , she was enrolled in the CMX - 001 CMV prevention study on protocol 2718 . She will continue
Valacyclovir 500 mg PO every 12 hours for HSV and VZV prophylaxis while receiving > 0 . 5mg / kg of
daily corticosteroid therapy to manage GVHD .

4 . STEROID INDUCED HYPERGLYCEMIA . Ms. Ryan has achieved improved control of her pre - lunch and
pre - dinner glucose levels between 170-210 mg / dL . She has been counseled extensively about the
dietary management component of her hyperglycemia and has made a concerted effort to abide by
the dietician’s recommended restrictions of high glycemic beverages and snacks . Her recent trend of
symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes marked by glucose nadirs in the 60 s have resolved since
discontinuing her evening NPH dose of 15 units on October 5 , 2014 . She will continue surveillance
AC and HS and dose 60 units of NPH insulin every morning , 7 units Lispro and medium dose SSI
pre - breakfast , 10 units Lispro and medium dose SSI pre - lunch and dinner with avoidance of high
carbohydrate intake outside of mealtimes . Ms. Ryan will require continued weekly dietary
monitoring of her home glucose log to guide appropriate adjustments to her insulin regimen as a
corticosteroid taper is likely to be resumed on or around October 23 , 2014 .

5 . HYPERTENSION . Ms. Ryan’s hypertension had been well controlled on Amlodipine 10 mg PO daily .
Her recent blood pressure trend reviewed from clinics on October 14 and October 21 , 2014
underscore poorly controlled hypertension with pressures peaking in the 150 / 100s range .
Carvedilol 6.25 mg PO every 12 hours will be added to the current Amlodipine dose to optimize
Ms. Ryan’s blood pressure control as she continues on the likely pharmaceutical precipitants of
Tacrolimus and Prednisone .

6 . GERD . Ms. Ryan’s reflux is well controlled with a twice daily PPI . She will continue Pantoprazole 40 mg
PO every 12 hours .

7 . ANXIETY / DEPRESSION . Ms. Ryan will start Ritalin 2.5 mg PO every morning to stabilize her low moods
and promote motivation for self - management of her post-transplant recovery , especially as relates to
recreational exercise to counteract corticosteroid induced myopathy . She has declined interest in
meeting with social work , psychology , or psychiatry throughout her transplant course to assist with
evaluations for determining her emotional needs and feasibility of initiating an anxiolytic or
antidepressant therapy to facilitate coping and care plan compliance during her post-transplant
recovery .

8 . DECONDITIONING . Ms. Ryan will continue to work with Physical Therapy weekly and requires
continued monitoring of her personal efforts to engage in purposeful , low impact exercise totaling
15-20 minutes daily . Energy conservation measures and journaling have been recommended to
motivate her continued involvement and accountability for the self-care and vital physical and
emotional rehabilitation components of her post-transplant recovery .

9 . ELECTROLYTE DEFICIENCY . Ms. Ryan requires continued oral potassium and intravenous
magnesium supplementation ( to limit prior gastrointestinal distress associated with oral
magnesium ) to normalize her levels . Her potassium level today was measured prior to her
supplement . She will continue 20 mEq KCL twice daily and 40 mEq KCL and 32 mEq Mg SO4 in
500 cc of 0.9 Normal Saline daily to supplement her oral hydration and minimize infusion effects
associated with a small volume diluent with the electrolyte dose

10 . NORMAL CALCIUM LEVEL of 9.5 mg/dL on October 21 , 2014 . AND a THERAPEUTIC VITAMIN D LEVEL
of 26.3 ng / mL on August 21 , 2014 . Ms. Ryan is currently on a daily maintenance Cholecalciferol
dose of 2 , 000units . A DEXA SCAN was performed during Ms. Ryan’s transplant course on
August 7 , 2014.21 at the SCCA and was revealing for significant osteopenia of the spine and bilateral
femoral necks . She will require a dose of Reclast prior to her discharge to the Heme-Onc service .

DISPOSITION
Ms. Ryan will have her LTFU evaluation on 10/22/2014 and return to the Red Team for a discharge summary conference during the week of October 27 , 2014 before transitioning to the care of Laura Connelly - Smith , MD of the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance during the week of October 27 , 2014 for continued disease and GVHD surveillance and management . She will continue her current corticosteroid therapy to pre - empt a GVHD flare and will have her immunosuppressant regimen adjusted based on clinical recommendations from the LTFU service .
