INTERVAL HISTORY
Marcia returns to clinic accompanied by her husband , Al , wearing a long dark wig . She is starting to feel recovered from her previous cycle and states that the week after cisplatin is the roughest . Her fatigue level remains the same and she attempts to stay busy by napping . She attended a party over the weekend and believes that she ate too much as she became nauseated and had an episode of emesis . She is taking around-the-clock antiemetics for retching and notes a decrease in appetite . She has an occasional twinge of pain at the right upper abdomen . She denies worsening peripheral neuropathy and only noted edema after her cycle of cisplatin . Her pain is usually well-controlled with fentanyl patch , but she notes a mild pain today as she is due to change her patch . Marcia is thrombocytopenic today and she endorses an occasional nose bleed , usually just a spot of blood when she blows her nose , but no other signs of bleeding , specifically no dark , tarry stools or bleeding of the gums . She is using saline nasal spray with some relief of nose bleeds . She continues to have occasional constipation and is now using bisacodyl prn as she did not like Miralax . Otherwise , Marcia denies fever , chills , headache , neurologic symptoms , chest pain , shortness of breath , or changes to bowel or bladder function . ECOG performance status is 1 .

Marcia and Al will be returning to Ohio August 23 to September 4 which should be a week off of therapy .

IMPRESSION
Marcia Friedman is a 70 - year - old postmenopausal woman with metastatic and BRCA1 - associated breast cancer . Sites of disease include diffuse bony metastasis as well as new hepatic lesions . Ms. Friedman 's history includes a diagnosis of node - positive left breast cancer in 1982 , treated with lumpectomy , axillary node dissection , whole breast radiation , adjuvant CMF for nine months , and then extended tamoxifen for 20+ years , discontinued in 2006 . She presented with metastatic breast cancer with bone pain in 2010 . Metastatic disease was confirmed by bone biopsy revealing ER positive , PR positive , and HER - 2 negative disease . She has received radiation to the L5 and T5 regions and has received 2 lines of endocrine therapy , the first with an aromatase inhibitor for a duration of approximately 12 months , and then most recently with fulvestrant with progression documented after approximately 10 months in March 2012 . She has continued on bisphosphonate therapy with zoledronic acid every 4 to 6 weeks .

Most recently Ms. Friedman 's LFTs were increased to the point that she was no longer eligible for the particular study locally . She reached out to our center and is interested in participating in our phase I clinical trial of ABT - 888 in combination with cisplatin and vinorelbine for patients with triple negative or BRCA1 or 2 - associated advanced breast cancer . Marcia has completed three cycles of therapy and is tolerating well , after an initial rough start with nausea and vomiting . Her LFTs continue to decline . Today Marcia is assymptomatically anemic and thrombocytopenic , with a Hct of 23 and platelet count of 37 . We will transfuse 2 units of PRBCs at the earliest convenience and continue to monitor Marcia 's platelets . We anticipate that her platelets will recover in time for Marcia 's next cycle in a week , but we will need to dose reduce her next cycle per protocol .

RECOMMENDATIONS
1 .
Type and Cross and transfuse 2 units PRBC 's . Patient was consented today .
2 .
Cycle 4 , day 1 scheduled on 7/27/2012 . Will dose reduce per protocol .
3 .
Continue IV hydration on Days 2-5 of chemotherapy .
4 .
Continue with antiemetic regimen including dexamethasone on day 2 , 3 after cisplatin .
5 .
Continue with zometa 4 mg IV Q6 weeks , next dose 8/16/2012 .
6 .
Iron studies pending . Consider iron sucrose for chemotherapy-induced anemia if indicated .
7 .
Requested that Ms. Friedman request copy of her BRCA1 testing report from 2001 for inclusion in her medical record .
8
Restaging CT scheduled 7/25/2012 with pre-medication for potential CT contrast allergy .
9 .
Return to clinic 7/27/2012 with Dr. Specht for review of restaging studies .

At the conclusion of our meeting today , I believe that Ms. Friedman 's questions were addressed . I spent 30 minutes with the patient today , the majority of which was in face - to - face counseling and coordination of care regarding management of chemotherapy toxicites for TNBC .
