DISCHARGE SUMMARY

DISCHARGE DATES
November 2 , 2009 to November 19 , 2009 .

IDENTIFICATION
Mr. Jorgenson is a 56 - year - old male who is now day 23 status post a double cord transplant for AML . He was admitted for generalized weakness and postural hypotension .

PROBLEM LIST
1 .
Protocol . The patient is enrolled in protocol 2275 . He also signed protocols 999-209 , 32 A , 1873 , 1831 , 1779 , 1760 , 1675 , 1607 and 1587 .

2 .
Conditioning chemotherapy . The patient received treosulfan at 14 gram / m ( 2 ) , from October 21-23 , 2009 . He then received fludarabine 30 mg / m ( 2 ) from October 21 , 2009 to October 25 , 2009 . This was followed by TBI at 200 cGy on October 26 , 2009 .

3 .
Infusion : The patient received his umbilical cord blood units on October 27 , 2009 . He received a total of 0.39 x 10 ^ 6 CD34 cells / kg .

4 .
Hematology : The patient is engrafting at time of discharge . His ANC is 720 with white blood cell count of 1.29 . He currently remains on daily G-CSF , as per his protocol and he will need to continue on this until ANC is 2500 . During this interim , his white blood cell count has ranged from too few cells to count to 1.29 . His ANC has also ranged from too few cells to count to 820 . He has had a platelet threshold of 25 K , secondary to diabetic retinopathy with history of retinal hemorrhages and vision changes . His hematocrit threshold was also increased to 30 % secondary to low DLCO , history of CABG and diabetic retinopathy issues . He has required daily platelets , if not twice daily platelets during his time here . He has a PRA of 29 % and has received pooled platelets only . The patient has also received almost daily red blood cell infusions for a hematocrit threshold of 30 % . He has had no signs of bleeding during this time .

5 .
Infectious disease .
Fevers of unknown origin : The patient spiked a neutropenic fever on November 7 , 2009 . His levofloxacin was subsequently broadened ceftazidime , however , this quickly defervesced after the initiation of ceftazidime . Blood cultures , urine cultures have all been negative to date . Ceftazidime was subsequently discontinued when an ANC was greater than 500 . He remains afebrile at this time .
Documented bacterial infection : None during this interim .
Documented fungal infection : The patient has a history of pulmonary nodules with a history of cannabis use . Pretransplant CT scan revealed small pulmonary nodules . He remained on voriconazole until 11/13/09 when he was switched to Micafungin in light of his elevated bilirubin . Micafungin was transitioned to Voriconazole upon discharge . Reasoning for this will be discussed in further detail below .
Documented viral infections : The patient was noted to have plasma CMV copies at 43 copies / ml on November 2 , 2009 . He was subsequently started on induction dose foscarnet on November 4 , 2009 and received a 7 - day course of this . Repeat CMV PCRs have always been negative and he has been on maintenance foscarnet since November 11 . He will need a 2 - week course of maintenance foscarnet and if his repeat CMVs continue to be negative , this will be able to be discontinued .

6 .
Pneumonitis . As mentioned above , the patient has a history of pulmonary nodules . Chest CT was performed on 11/12/09 that revealed improvement in size of pulmonary nodules . He has also had multiple chest x-rays during this interim for neutropenic surveillance and revealed clear lungs , small bibasilar atelectasis .

7 .
GVHD . The patient currently remains on cyclosporine and MMF . He was having twice weekly cyclosporine levels . The patient was noted to have one supratherapeutic level November 5 , 2009 with subsequent adjustment and his other cyclosporin levels have remained therapeutic during this interim . He will have a cyclosporine level pending tomorrow morning before being seen in the outpatient department .

The patient had continued generalized anorexia as well as nausea and vomiting , and GI was consulted November 12 , 2009 . Per GI , no endoscopy or flex sigmoidoscopy was done at that time and we will just continue to follow him at that point . At time of discharge , his nausea is significantly improved compared to before and he is eating . His PO intake is limited , however , improved since admission .

8 .
Regimen related toxicities .
A . ) Nausea and vomiting . The patient 's nausea is stable with a scopolamine patch as well as Marinol pre - meal . He has Compazine as needed .
B . ) Diarrhea : The patient has had intermittent diarrhea during this interim stay . Last C . difficile was checked on November 11 , 2009 . C . difficile EIA was positive ; however , C diff toxin B . gene PCR was negative . Therefore , no therapy was initiated . His diarrhea has ultimately resolved at time of discharge .

9 .
FEN . The patient always had poor PO intake during his time here . He was on intermittent TPN and this was able to be discontinued finally on November 15 , 2009 . He will be discharged on 1 L normal saline with potassium , magnesium and calcium . He has been noted to be hypophosphatemic , hypomagnesemic , hypocalcemic and hypokalemic during his time here , most likely secondary to foscarnet . His electrolytes have been replaced in his daily IV fluids .

10 .
Endocrinology . The patient has a history of diabetes . It was exacerbated by TPN and at time of discharge it was trending down with nighttime glargine 15 units . He also remains on medium dose sliding scale insulin .

11 .
Skin : The patient developed a rash in his inguinal area , most likely consistent with a fungal infection . The patient was using nystatin as needed and this has resolved at time of discharge .

12 .
Musculoskeletal . The patient had chronic bilateral shoulder pain attributed to many years of construction and this pain has been stable on oxycodone as needed .

13 .
GI. The patient has had a hyperbilirubinemia during his entire hospital stay . His bilirubin has ranged from 1.7 to 3.2 . The patient had a right upper quadrant ultrasound performed on November 5 , 2009 in light of the elevated bilirubin . It was negative for VOD . There was noted cholelithiasis , but no evidence of cholecystitis and no dilatation . During our GI consult , we discussed his elevated bilirubin and suggested that we discontinue his voriconazole . His voriconazole was subsequently discontinued , however , his total bilirubin continued to be elevated . Therefore the patient will be placed back on voriconazole upon discharge 200 mg PO twice daily and continue to follow his LFTs very closely .

14 .
Neurology . The patient also developed mild confusion and sedation , but was easily reoriented and redirectable once awake . His sedating medications were discontinued such as Ativan and his confusion has resolved at the time of discharge .

2 .
Disease . The patient 's day - 21 chimerism revealed 80 % CD3 + from donor 1 and 100 % CD3 3+ from donor 1 . Donor 2 revealed 0 % CD3 + and 0 % CD3 3+ . The patient will require a day - 28 bone marrow evaluation and day - 28 peripheral chimerism . This will be done in the outpatient department .
3 .
Status post neutropenic fever .
4 .
Stable pulmonary nodules noted on chest CT . Currently discharged on voriconazole .
5 .
CMV reactivation . Patient currently remains on maintenance foscarnet . He will continue to have CMV PCR checked weekly . He will need to have a 2 - week course of maintenance foscarnet since November 11 , 2009 .
6 .
Hypertension . The patient remains on Norvasc 10 mg PO daily .
7 .
GVHD . The patient remains on cyclosporine and MMF . He has a cyclosporine level pending before his AM dose tomorrow morning . Per GI , the patient did not undergo an endoscopy or flex sigmoidoscopy to further evaluate his nausea and vomiting , which has ultimately improved since admission .

Hyperbilirubinemia : stable / decreasing , probably multifactorial including conditiong . Orthostasis : resolved , deconditioning and potentially autonomic neuropathy , Nausea / poor po intake : likely regimen related , resolving with reasonable po intake . Dispo : overall improving with better PO intake will be discharged to SCCA OPD today .
