PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICE : INITIAL CONSULT


ID / CC / REASON FOR CONSULT :

We appreciate the request from Dr. Lee , attending physician of the HemOnc service , to consult for Goals of Care .

OUTPATIENT PROVIDERS :
PCP : Paul Sutton
Specialists : Oncologist Bill Harris

HPI : Steve is a 55 y/o man with metastatic colorectal cancer . He has had rapid disease progression complicated by a malignant pleural effusion and ascites . He is several weeks out from chemotherapy but has had significant complications including debility , mucositis , worsening ascites causing abdominal pain and pleural effusions causing shortness of breath . He is status post pleurex drain on 6/16/14 .

Participants : Today Steve , his wife Effie , and the Palliative Care Team ( Stu Farber and Jeff Beck ) .

Social History : Steve and Effie have three children Nick , Andrew , and Collin .

Understanding : Steve described that two weeks ago he was doing fairly well and described his clinical deterioration . He specifically mentioned his difficulty with not being able to eat ( due to mucositis ) , weakness , and loss of functional status . He stated , " I can 't really do anything "

Steve knows that his functional status is too poor to be a candidate for further chemotherapy .

Hopes : Steve 's main hopes revolve around regaining some strength so that he can have time with his wife , boys , and friends . He hopes to be able to write letters to loved ones as legacy . He hopes to be able to eat a meal again , and he hopes to be home . Steve hopes that at the end of life that he is able to express gratitude and be surrounded by family .

Effie hopes that Steve can feel that he is not a burden on her or the kids . She hopes he can be comfortable and that the end of his life is calm .

Worries : Steve 's main concern is being a burden on others . He doesn 't want to be debilitated , diminished , and dependent .

Effie 's main concerns are about the boys and their different ways of processing .

Acceptable quality of life : Steve worries about

Strengths / Role of faith : Steve 's main strengths are his wife and boys .

We had a long discussion about grief and the different expressions of grief that each person may have . We discuss legacy and allowing each family member to respond to Steve 's illness and end of life as they feel is appropriate . We discussed the difficulty that people who care for others their entire lives can have being cared for . In that vein we also discussed how meaningful and important it can be for Steve 's family members to care for him .

Clinically , we discussed the uncertainty surrounding the situation clinically , not knowing what degree of Steve 's debility is disease progression and what degree is chemotherapy toxicity . In that way finding ways to support him at home is important .

PHYSICAL EXAM :
Steve was alert and interactive but deconditioned and tired in appearance . His speech was quiet . He was breathing comfortably . His thoughts were clear and coherent .

IMPRESSION :
Steve is a 55 y/o man who has aggressive metastatic colorectal cancer . He is several weeks s/p chemotherapy and is struggling with debility , pleural effusions and ascites . He is s/p pleurex 6 / 16 and will likley undergo paracentesis 6 / 18 . At this time Steve 's main goal is to regain strength if possible and spend time with his family . To that end it is unclear how much function Steve will be able to regain . As discharge approaches , it is clear that Steve and Effie would like him home . It is likely that Home Care will be the best support service for Steve at this time . Providence could provide both Transitions Care and Home Care , which would allow for therapies at home that Steve needs while time is given to see if he can recover some strength as the effects of chemotherapy wane . If Steve 's clinical status continues to worsen then Providence would be able to transition him to hospice caer . It is the goal of the family that Steve 's death be calm , peaceful , and at home .

I discussed this visit with SW Marie Nelson , Oncologist Bill Harris , the primary RN , PCP Paul Sutton and the Primary Team . Prior to discharge it will be important to sort out a plan for nutrition , hydration , and symptom management .

RECOMMENDATIONS :
- When Steve is ready for discharge , recommend Providence for Transitions and Home Care .
- Recommend Grief Support for Effie and their sons ( discussed this support with Primary SW ) .

Thank you for asking the Palliative Care team to be involved in the care of this patient . Please page the team via the paging operator with any specific questions or concerns .
