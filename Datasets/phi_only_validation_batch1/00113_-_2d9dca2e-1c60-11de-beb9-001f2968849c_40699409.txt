Radiological Studies
CT KUB 4 / 17 : mild-to-moderate right hydroureteronephrosis which was not present on 3/18/2015 .
A definitive extrinsically compressing mass or retroperitoneal adenopathy causing this process is not identified .

Problems / Assessment / Plan
This is a 70 yo F with locally advanced L ureteral transitional cell carcinoma s/p c1 gem / cis on 4 / 6 who presents with new onset anuric acute renal failure .

# Anuric ARF : Pt has produced 35 cc UOP over previous 24hrs . Multifactoral etiology including pre-renal , obstructive , query chemo toxicity .
- No signs of uremia on exam , Pt showing signs of mild volume overload with edema noted .
- FeNa 0.2 % consistent with pre-renal etiology . IVF 500 cc bolus x2 today - continue prn IVF judiciously - appreciate nephrology team assist with volume status .
- Per discussion with pharmacy team , unlikely cisplatin toxicity due to length of time > 1 week since exposure to chemotherapy ( typically see toxicity within 5 days from chemotherapy exposure ) . ATN Casts not noted on Urine spin by nephrology team last night - appreciate assist .
- Pt to OR today for right ureteral stent placement due to hydronephrosis noted on CT ( unclear if extrinsic obstruction as we were unable to use contrast on CT imaging ) . Appreciate urology team assist - f/u post procedure .
- Measure UOP with indwelling foley catheter .
- Monitor for UCx results - - ngtd .
- Hold lisinopril , oxybutinin
- BMP Q12hrs - -

# Hyperkalemia : Due to ARF . Improved today , K + 5.3 . Pt resistant to Kayexalate and insulin therapy .
- Continue prn bolus IVF , telemetry monitoring , BMP Q12hr .
- Tx ARF per problem above .
- Renal diet post procedure .

# Locally advanced left ureteral transitional cell carcinoma : Followed by Dr Yu at SCCA . S/p left ureteral stent placement 2 / 2014 , s/p neoadjuvent chemotherapy cycle # 1 , gem / cis Day 1 : 4 / 6 complicated by poor po intake following chemotherapy , now mild / mod . hydronephrosis R kidney and ARF .
- Dr Yu aware of admission - will follow up post discharge for further management .
- Urology team and Dr Gore following - place ureteral stent today .

# GERD : Continue PPI IV , start Zantac , Sucralfate

# CV : CAD , HTN , valvular disease . Borderling hypotensive which appears stable for this patient . Continue to hold antihypertensives for now .
IVF PRN

# Chronic low back pain , cancer pain : Cont fentanyl patch , judicious prn morphine . Cont doc / senna .

# Depression / anxiety . Cont home meds .
- pt requesting to talk with chaplan
