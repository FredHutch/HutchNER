MICRO :
- Blood cx 8 / 23 : NGTD
- UCx 8 / 23 : NGTD

IMAGING :

- CT Chest 8/23/2016 : Bilateral groundglass opacities with a geographic distribution likely
represent acute lung injury including pulmonary hemorrhage . Differential
diagnosis includes an infectious etiology given the patient 's immunosuppressed
status . Pulmonary edema should also be included in the diagnosis given the
patient 's fluid overloaded status . + incidental thyroid nodule .
- XR Chest 8/23/2016 : patchy lung consolidation , worse on the left than the right ,
worrisome for pneumonia or hemorrhage . There is also diffuse lung disease ,
likely edema .
- Noncontrast head CT 8/23/2016 : small left frontal subgaleal hematoma , otherwise nl
- US Lower Extremity ( 08/22/2016 10:28 ) : negative


ASSESSMENT & PLAN :

70 F with AML with monocytic differentiation ( NPM1 + , FLT3 - , 46XX ) presenting for G - CLAM induction

# AML
Bone marrow demonstrated 100 % myeloid blasts with minimal residual hematopoiesis . Peripheral blood had 19 % blasts . Normal karyotype 46XX with negative AML FISH panel ( 7q31 , trisomy 8 , t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q21 ; q22 ) , 11q23 , t ( 15 ; 7 ) ( q24 ; q2 1.1 ) , 16q22 ) . Negative for CEBPA , FLT3 and positive for NPM1 . Treatment-related mortality score 2.8 ( low risk ) .
- G - CLAM ( D1 = 8 / 20 ) . Chemo regimen 8 / 23 held - - restarting this afternoon .
- Holding dose D0 and D1 of filgrastim given large blast burden , D2 - 5 still in place
- Acyclovir , posaconazole ; no levofloxacin with ceftaz on board

# Hemoptysis , hypoxemia , and b/l symmetric pulm infiltrates , most likely DAH in setting of DIC from treatment of AML and moderative volume overload / pulmonary edema : Aspiration pneumonitis and / or PNA also possible , ACS and PE less likely ( duplex LEs 8 / 22 negative ) . No high-risk hx for TB . EKG nl .
- respiratory virus panel , Cdiff , GM negative
- cough suppression : guaifen / codeine , tessalon perles
- increased transfusion thresholds : HCT > 25 , Plts > 50 , Fibrinogen > 150
- diuresis with Lasix 40 mg IV ( likely bid ) to goal of net negative 1-2 L , ~ 1 kg down
- 2 view CXR tomorrow to monitor disease ( expecting resolution )

# Neutropenic Fever : possible febrile RBC transfusion reaction vs . fever from cytarabine without dex suppression vs . inflammatory response related to DAH - - suspicion for infection is low given afebrile and lack of focal imaging findings or sepsis picture .
- fu Blood cx
- remains on ceftazadine 2 mg IV q8 hrs , vancomycin 1 g q12 hrs - - will discontinue ( and add levo prophylaxis ) once afebrile > 48 hours
- remains on voriconazole ( will switch back to fluconazole on discharge for insurance purposes )

# FEN : unlikely to develop significant TLS after this point
- TLS labs liberalized to Q12Hr
- prophylactic allopurinol
- mIVF discontinued in setting of pulmonary edema
- calcium carbonate 500 bid discontinued for hyperphosphatemic
- sevelemar for hyperphos

# GI nausea / vomiting / diarrhea : improved , most likely chemo toxicity , Cdiff PCR negative .

# Thyroid nodule , incidentally noted : thyroid ultrasound when stable and / or as outpatient

Chronic / stable issues :
# Back pain : oxycodone 2.5-5 mg q4 hours PRN , bowel regimen : miralax , senna PRN
# LE cramping w / h/o PE 2005 : no DVT by LE duplex . Unclear etiology , most likely muscle strain . PT consulted , encourage mobility , ice and / or warm compresses as needed
# H/o PE 2005 not on AC : Will become thrombocytopenic , so no further AC planned . CTM
# Osteopenia : Continue Ca , Vit D
# Depression : Continue fluoxetine

FEN : Immunosuppressed
TLD : Hickman
DVT ppx : SCDs
Code : Full
Contacts : Dave Lehnis , brother , 360-480 - 7933 ; Roberta , friend , 206-769 - 6721
Dispo : Home with caregivers once s/p chemo , discharge delayed x1 day given chemo held x1 day


ATTENDING ADDENDUM :

I saw and evaluated the patient , and I agree with the resident 's note . Patient has done remarkably well overnight , and has resolved her DIC . O2 requirement is down to 2 L ( satting 97 % ) , so we will proceed with day 4 chemotherapy today ( which is tehcnically day 5 ) .
