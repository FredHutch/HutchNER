ID / CC :
Mr. James " Jim " Chenoweth is a 54 y.o. Seattle man ( recently moved back to his home from Thailand / China ) with a KRAS - mutated metastatic rectal cancer to lungs , bone , lymph , and liver , who was referred to the SUPPORTIVE AND PALLIATIVE CARE service on the basis of high distress on the Universal Screening Questionnaire . I first saw him on September 14 , 2016 . Today is our first follow-up visit to discuss pain and symptom management and possible CAM support for treatment .
.

CONSULTATION INFORMATION :
Addressed during this visit : Patient 's narrative , Goals of care , Symptom management , Education about palliative care , Patient / family centered emotional support .
Participants : Patient .
Spouse : QIN ( DUMA ) DU WIFE ( 206 ) 565-9879 .

PLAN :
# Problem : INTRO TO PALLIATIVE CARE
.
Impression : Patient has some knowledge of PALLIATIVE CARE based on research he has done . He shares today that he first thought it was about pain management and end-of-life care . He appreciated the discussions at our first meeting as well at today 's . He is interested in continued support from our service .
.
Plan : 1 . I reiterated the SUPPORTIVE AND PALLIATIVE CARE service and some of the other things that we can provide . I again noted that we consider the caregiver support system as an extension of our service . We can , therefore , also offer support to Duma and other family / caregivers in addition to our direct support to patient .
2 . I previously provided our brochure and noted that the patient can request specific palliative care providers , but that there may be some times when he or she is not available . At those times , they will be offered the opportunity to see another member of our team or to reschedule for when a preferred provider is available . Patient noted that he would prefer to maintain the same PALLIATIVE CARE provider , when possible , in order NOT to have to repeat his story too many times .
.
# Problem : PAIN MANAGEMENT
.
Impression : Patient abruptly stopped all opioids a few days after our last visit . He declines to say why other than he doesn 't like having his life dictated by scheduled meds , in particular . When he had problems filling his oxycodone Rx just after our visit , he decided to do without any of them . He had a week 's worth of nausea , lethargy , pain , diarrhea . He attributed most of that to chemo toxicity . He remains off opioids apart from a few intermittent doses of oxycodone . He currently feels his pain is under acceptable control . He understands the concept of scheduled long-acting pain meds and staying ahead of the pain rather than chasing it .
See BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY , below .

PAIN PRESCRIBER :
Kaylyn " Kit " Wong , MD

CURRENT PAIN REGIMEN
= MS - CONTIN 60 mg tab . Stopped on September 19 .
= oxycodone 5 mg tabs . DOSE : take 1-2 tabs PO Q4H , PRN , BTP . ( patient has been taking infrequently ) .
.
Plan : 1 . We discussed the sudden stoppage of opioids and the fact that most of the symptoms he attributed to chemo - intolerance were actually withdrawal .
2 . Now that he has largely gone through withdrawal and is relatively comfortable on much lower doses of opioids , and only short-acting opioids , I advised to continue with short-acting only .
3 . Palliative Care will continue to follow and advise on pain issues . We are open to taking over as primary prescribers , but only after discussion with Dr. Wong or her team .
.
# Problem : CONSTIPATION MANAGEMENT
.
Impression : Patient no longer has opioid - induced constipation on the lower doses of opioids .
.
Plan : 1 . Monitor for return of constipation , esp . if opioids escalate .
.
# Problem : GOALS OF CARE / TREATMENT DECISION-MAKING
.
Impression : Patient remains ambivalent about standard oncology care . He has yet to investigate some of the resources I gave him a couple of weeks ago but remains interested in looking into them .

.
Plan : 1 . We discussed his ambivalence and the fact that he already regrets NOT having pursued some options . He seems to have a good understanding that he cannot pursue ALL options and does have to make clear choices at times .
2 . I previously suggested two options that he was not aware of . I encouraged him to follow up with these as they may help align his care with his closely held values .

= consultation at the John Bastyr University " SUPPORTIVE ONCOLOGY CLINIC . " They do not treat cancer but may have suggestions and help him sort through all the alternative care options he has researched on the internet . They tend to be a bit conservative based on a respect they have for conventional treatments .

= Seattle Cancer Treatment and Wellness Center . They have staff oncologists and treat cancer with non - evidence - based strategies , often at smaller doses or longer intervals between treatments . They also have naturopathic physicians on staff to address complementary approaches side - by - side . While their approach makes treatment less toxic for some patients , the non-standard approach is looked down upon by many oncologists because they are not evidence - based .
3 . I noted that for metastatic disease , many conventional oncologists will be more flexible with doses or dosing intervals to help preserve a patient 's comfort and quality of life over the longer term . I believe that Dr. Wong has already modified his dosage to make it less toxic for him . She is open to discussing ways to make treatment tolerable while keeping it strong enough to provide benefit .
.
# Problem : PSYCHO - SOCIAL SUPPORT
.
Impression : While Mr. Chenoweth is from the Seattle area and still owns a home here , he has not lived her much over the past decade . He has a slim social support system here . He has unconventional views about optimal treatment for his cancer ( discussed above ) .
Patient 's wife , Duma , who is a 35 y.o. native Chinese woman and never visited the US for any length of time before , is also likely feeling a bit isolated
. .
Plan : 1 . I suggested that he may want to seek out support groups through Cancer Lifeline . They also have an on - line presence .
2 . I asked whether I could give his name to another patient of mine who is sensible , thoughtful , and an " outside the box " thinker . Same cancer . Same age . He was very interested in that . With patient 's permission , I have gone ahead and forwarded his name and number to my other patient ( who I saw later today ) .
3 . Look for opportunities to support patient 's wife , Duma .
.

Disposition

CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS :

Palliative Care Discussion
Understanding / Perspective Of Illness : Patient understands that he has a metastatic cancer , which recurred post surgery and an abbreviated course of adjuvant chemotherapy . He looks , in hindsight , at the fact that he might not have had recurrence if he had gone through with the entire recommended 12 cycles of FOLFOX . He tends to read ( on - line ) and research about anti - cancer treatments and complementary treatments . Plus , he has been living internationally where treatments have been entertained and offered which are not available in the US . He feels some alienation from the health - care / oncology care system in the US for being less imaginative or creative than they seem to be in Asia . He does use complementary medications suggested by his Thai providers which he has purchased on - line . These are known to his SCCA oncologist , Kaylyn " Kit " Wong , and listed in her recent notes .
.
Hopes And What Brings Life Meaning Or Purpose : Patient is hopeful at finding a well-tolerated , effective treatment for his cancer . He would like a cure ( " in an ideal world " ) though understands that it is technically not curable .
.
Strengths , Role Of Spirituality , Faith , Religion , Spiritual Assessment : He has a belief that everything is predetermined " in a Newtonian sense . " There are few , if any , accidents . Conditions exist which are immutable and cause certain things to happen , including his cancer and the ( possible ) cure for his cancer . He feels a need to explore as many alternatives as possible to be sure he has accessed the conditions he needs to achieve his cure . At the same time , he recognizes that time limitations preclude exploring or examining every single possibility .
.
Communication Preferences : He likes factual information and placing known information into a larger context that can include theoretical applications of science . An example is the " ketogenic diet " which is potentially toxic to cancer . This would be opposed to a normal diet which could feed the cancer , and allow it to thrive , even as it nourishes the healthy cells of the body .
.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
( From Dr. Kaylyn Wong’s initial note of August 23 , 2016 with edits and additions . )
Mr. Chenoweth is originally from Seattle , but lived in China and Thailand for most of the past 9 years with intermittent travels to the US . He first experienced pain on defecation in early 2014 . He was seen at the Polyclinic in Seattle , and apparently , he underwent some tests that were negative ( we do not have these records ) . He was recommended to get a colonoscopy , but did not obtain one until he was in India in January 2014 . This apparently showed a rectal mass . Biopsy was consistent with adenocarcinoma ( records unavailable ) . He does not remember having had CT or MRI imaging .

He then underwent LAR in Thailand on February 11 , 2014 . A pathology report from the surgery is available in English ; this showed a 3.5 cm well-differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma of the rectum , invading through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues , positive LVI , clear margins , 5 / 21 lymph nodes involved with extranodal extension . ( Subsequent re-read by UW Pathology on August 31 , 2016 confirms this report . ) Mr. Chenoweth then received adjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX ( 8 cycles ) in China , completed in August 2014 . He was recommended to complete 12 cycles but was feeling poorly on chemo so elected to discontinue early . He did not receive local radiation to the pelvis .

Since his LAR , he has had stool changes with a tendency toward constipation that , when treated , can result in explosive and difficulty to manage diarrhea . He rather prefers to maintain some constipation and has not found a suitable system for management though uses Miralax from time - to - time .

Thereafter , he was on surveillance with CTs every 6 months in Thailand . He also had colonoscopy in August 2014 , which showed 2 hyperplastic polyps , one of which had a focus of low-grade dysplasia .

He returned to the US in July 2015 and got married . Around that time , he experienced increasing pain . He returned to Thailand , and PET / CT on August 10 , 2015 showed lung metastases , abnormal subcarinal and right hilar lymph nodes , as well as new bone metastases ( T2 , left scapula , left iliac wing , right femur ) . He was treated with radiation to lymph nodes and bone in Thailand in August 2015 , but no systemic therapy . He took a treatment hiatus to seek out alternative therapies for some time .

Repeat PET / CT on February 13 , 2016 showed progressive lung metastases and new lesions , particularly in the bone ( involving T-spine , sacrum , pelvis , femoral neck , humerus , scapula , ribs ) , right liver , both lungs , and lymph nodes . CEA increased to 256 . He also clinically deteriorated due to severe pain .

He was started on FOLFIRI and Avastin in Thailand on February 21 , 2016 , along with zoledronic acid 4 gm IV every 4 weeks . He never obtained a Port and was receiving his chemo through peripheral veins . His pain quickly resolved upon starting treatment , and he clinically felt better . He believes that zoledronic acid helped with his bone pain . He did not have significant side effects from the FOLFIRI , aside from mild nausea , constipation , mucositis and weakness for a few days . CEA significantly improved upon initiation of FOLFIRI / Avastin ( down to the 20 s ) . In late April 2016 , post - 6 cycles ( 3 months ) of chemotherapy , his oncologist recommended another 6 cycles , but Mr. Chenoweth was tired of IV chemotherapy and tried TS - 1 ( oral therapy ) for some time . However , his CEA increased again ( to 392 ) .

He resumed FOLFIRI / Avastin on June 19 , 2016 . Again , upon initiation of chemotherapy , CEA decreased to 97 by the time he had the eighth cycle on July 3 , 2016 . He then moved back to Seattle on August 1 , 2016 . He first met with Dr. Wong at SCCA on August 23 , 2016 . He had been on treatment hiatus of 6 weeks by then and was experiencing increasing pain in the low back with intermittent radiation down both LEs . Pain was restricting his activity and he lost general strength without specific LE weakness or bowel changes . He was treating the pain with Tramadol and short-acting oxycodone .

Dr. Wong started him back on FOLFIRI / Avastin which he started ( cycle # 9 ) on August 31 . She also started him on long - and short-acting opioids . He has had improvement in his pain , seemingly from both the chemotherapy and the pain meds . He has been more active around home , though does not have an exercise program per se . He has lost weight , some of that being intentional as he weighed 102 Kg at one point and had a self - described “beer belly” . He has some anorexia but has not felt urgency to maximize calories . He has not had frank nausea or vomiting . He has not had profuse diarrhea , though continues to have intermittent constipation with a tendency toward diarrhea when it is relieved by medication ( as before ) .
