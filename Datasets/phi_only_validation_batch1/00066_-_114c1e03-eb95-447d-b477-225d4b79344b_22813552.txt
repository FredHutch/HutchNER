IDENTIFICATION
Jaishri Grant is a 49 - year - old woman who has a long history of AML since 2004 , that relapsed after ASCT ( August / 2004 ) , presented with persistent disease on day +56 after a RIC MRD PBSCT ( August / 2009 ) , and that is here today for evaluation before DLI , off 4 cycles of MEC and antibody CXCR4 as salvage chemotherapy .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms. Grant was first diagnosed with her AML in April 2004 after presenting with fatigue , increased bruising and a right ear infection . CBC at that time showed anemia , thrombocytopenia and a white count greater than 50 , 000 with a large number of blasts in the peripheral blood type .

She had a bone marrow aspiration , showing AML with normal cytogenetic but unknown FLT3 NPM1 status . She underwent induction with idarubicin and ara-C on a 7 + 3 schedule , and needed to be reinduced due to persistent disease . After that a new bone marrow aspiration showing complete remission with a CT scan of the chest showing marked decrease in mediastinal mass that had been identified prior to her first induction . She underwent mobilization with mitoxantrone and cytarabine followed by autologous stem cell transplant on August 2004 . She was followed regularly with a 5 1 / 2 to 6 year remission until December 2009 . At this point , her white count declining to 1800 and a bone marrow aspiration , in January , was hypocellular with left myeloid shift . Cytogenetic were normal with FLT3 being negative with FISH studies for MDS pain also being negative .

Due decreasing count , she repeated a bone marrow on 03/12/10 1 showing 11.8 % abnormal blasts with noted normal cytogenetics . In April 2010 , was started on decitabine followed by 7+ 3 chemotherapy in May 2010 .

She then underwent a reduced intensity peripheral blood stem cell transplant , on 08/09/2010 , with the donor being her father and had persistent disease on her day 56 marrow . On 11/29/10 , bone marrow aspiration shows 6.5 % abnormal blasts by flow with normal cytogenetic and tremors showing 2 out of 20 cells being female , 18 out of 20 cells male . On 10 / 2010 she started Vidaza for three cycles , which ended on 12/12/10 . A bone marrow on 12/08/11 showing 36.7 % blasts by flow with normal cytogenetic and mostly male chimerism .

Tried to get patient on UW - 09036 protocol but could not secondary to elevated LFTs ( most likely Exjade ) and also decreased ejection fraction on MUGA ( 35 % ) . She was sent home with prednisone and lisinopril and was followed locally in UCLA , and her EF improved greatly . She has been supported with red blood cells , but has not required platelets since March .

She had a new bone marrow aspiration on 06/16/2011 that revealed by flow 90 %
blasts . FLT3 negative , with abnormal cytogenetic on 18 of 200 cells ( translocation ( 1:12 ) , deletion of 7 q and deletion of 5 q ) . At that day , patient signed informed consent UW protocol 09036 , use of anti - CXCR4 antibody plus mitoxantrone , etoposide , and ara - C . She had a MUGA with a LVEF of 52 % .

She completed 4 cycles , from July / 11 to December / 11 , last cycle started on 12/01/11 .

After the 3 rd cycle , on 10/12/11 , she had a bone marrow aspiration with 2.3 % blasts by flow , 1.5 % by pathology and with 2 out of 220 cells showing cytogenic abnormalities ( translocation ( 1:12 ) and deletion 7 q ) .

Her last bone marrow evaluation was done on 11/29/11 , showing 0.8 % blasts by flow with a normal cytogenetic .

The first cycle was complicated with severe mucositis , and on the following courses the cytabarine dose was reduced on 25 % . Over the courses , she also developed episodes febrile neutropenia that resolved , and was notice to be VRE positive . On last cycle , mitoxantrane was held once she had a new MUGA on 11/15/11 that revealed a decreased LVEF from 55 to 34-35 % .

She is presenting here today for evaluation before DLI on 12/15/11 , with the donor being her father .

2 . HEME
Neutropenic and transfusion dependent . She will be transfused for standard tresholds . She is on exjede for iron overload .

3 . ID
Fevers , likely related to disease . She is on linezolide since 12/03/11 .
PPX acyclovir , dapsone , levofloxacin .
History of presumed Aspergillus pneumonia . She had a CT scan on 12/01/11 that showed Further interval decrease in size and density of multiple pulmonary nodules , with mild residual , consistent with aspergillosis . She was on double coverage with Micafungin and Voriconazole , but after ID evaluation she discontinued Micafungin on 12/04/2011 and will continue with the voriconazole .

4 . RESPIRATORY
See item 3 .

5 . CARDIOVASCULAR

Mild global hypokinesis in the right and left ventricle , without regional wall motion abnormalities . 2 . LVEF of 35-36 % , which is persistently abnormal . This it is not significantly changed compared to the most recent cardiac MUGA dated November 30 , 2011 or baseline MUGA dated March 7 , 2011 . However , LVEF is still significantly decreased compared to cardiac MUGA dated September 27 , 2011 . On carvedlilol 6.25 PO twice daily .
