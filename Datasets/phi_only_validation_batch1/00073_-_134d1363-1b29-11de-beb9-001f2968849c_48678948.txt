MICRO :
- Blood cx 8 / 23 : pending

IMAGING :
- CXR 8 / 23 bedside read : no significant effusion , no PTX , R hilar fullness / possible consolidation , moderate volume overload

ASSESSMENT & PLAN :
70 F with AML with monocytic differentiation ( NPM1 + , FLT3 - , 46XX ) presenting for G - CLAM induction

# AML
Bone marrow demonstrated 100 % myeloid blasts with minimal residual hematopoiesis . Peripheral blood had 19 % blasts . Normal karyotype 46XX with negative AML FISH panel ( 7q31 , trisomy 8 , t ( 8 ; 21 ) ( q21 ; q22 ) , 11q23 , t ( 15 ; 7 ) ( q24 ; q2 1.1 ) , 16q22 ) . Negative for CEBPA , FLT3 and positive for NPM1 . Treatment-related mortality score 2.8 ( low risk ) .
- G - CLAM ( D1 = 8 / 20 )
- Holding dose D0 and D1 of filgrastim given large blast burden , D2 - 5 still in place
- Acyclovir , posaconazole ; discontinue levofloxacin with ceftaz on board

# Neutropenic Fever : possible febrile RBC transfusion reaction , suspicion for infection
- Blood cx , urinalysis with urine cx
- Begin ceftazadine 2 mg IV q8 hrs

# Hemoptysis , coagulopathy , hypoxemia , L sided chest " pinching " : most likely cough inducing small middle / lower airway vessel burst which is triggering further coughing etc . as well as moderate volume overload given fluids . Aspiration pneumonitis and / or PNA also possible , ACS and PE less likely ( duplex LEs 8 / 22 negative ) .
- respiratory virus panel
- EKG
- cough suppression : guaifen / codeine
- increasing transfusion thresholds : HCT > 25 , Plts > 50 , Fibrinogen > 150
- transfusing cryopreciptate x3 units , plts x2 units to goals above
- Vit K for INR = 1.5

# GI nausea / vomiting / diarrhea : most likely chemo toxicity , unlikely Cdiff given only on levofloxacin for x1 day
- Cdiff PCR
- CTM

# FEN : WBC now ~ 2 , unlikely to develop significant TLS after this point
- TLS labs Q8Hr
- prophylactic allopurinol
- mIVF NS 150 - - > 100 cc/hr ( volume overload )
- calcium carbonate 500 bid discontinued for hyperphosphatemic
- sevelemar for hyperphos

# Back pain : likely related to malignancy
- oxycodone 2.5-5 mg q4 hours PRN
- bowel regimen : miralax , senna PRN

# LE cramping w / h/o PE 2005 : no DVT by LE duplex . Unclear etiology , most likely muscle strain .
- PT consulted , encourage mobility , ice and / or warm compresses as needed

# Thyroid nodule : thyroid ultrasound when stable and / or as outpatient

# H/o PE 2005 not on AC : Will become thrombocytopenic , so no further AC planned . CTM
# Osteopenia : Continue Ca , Vit D
# Depression : Continue fluoxetine

FEN : Immunosuppressed
TLD : Hickman
DVT ppx : None for now ( encourage ambulation - - prefer to avoid LMWH given impending thrombocytopenia and prefer to avoid SCDs when ruling out DVTs )

Contacts : Dave Lehnis , brother , 360-480 - 7933 ; Roberta , friend , 206-769 - 6721
Dispo : Home with caregivers once s/p chemo

ATTENDING ADDENDUM :

I saw and evaluated the patient , and I agree with the resident 's note . Patient has new fever , new O2 requirement up to 4 L/nc , new DIC , and new hemoptysis overnight . Cultures pending , and CXR / CR chest both demonstrate diffuse infiltrates concerning for acute lung injury , whether related to DAH vs . pulmonary edema vs . infection . TRALI is also possible though timing with onset of dyspnea appeared to be significantly after initation of PRBC transfusion . Appreciate pulmonary input . Will hold off on day 4 chemotherapy for tonight , since O2 requirement did not improve significantly throughout the day despite steroids and Lasix ; hope to reinitiate final two days of chemotherapy tomorrow 8 / 24 instead . Case was discussed today at weekly leukemia patient conference as well .
