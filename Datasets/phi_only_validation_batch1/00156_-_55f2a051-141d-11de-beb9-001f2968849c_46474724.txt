ASSESSMENT & PLAN :

72 yo woman with peristomal hernia here for proposed revision of colostomy and repair of peristomal hernia , scheduled for early afternoon today .

History of leiomyosarcoma status post chemoradiation and surgical resection .
Chronic rectal pain and fecal urgency .
Peristomal hernia with recent small bowel obstruction .
History of tubulovillous and tubular adenoma of the colon .
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease .

Chronic left lower extremity DVT with venous stents placed in 2013 ; history of line assoc dvt in past
- anticoagulation with warfarin at home , enoxaparin bridge here , last dose yesterday AM
- note INR of 1.7 this morning
- I would like to try FFP rather than vit K to get her INR down prior to the case
Cervical spine stenosis .
History of decreased EF chemotherapy toxicity in past , no e / o CHF now
Moderate aortic stenosis , on TTE 4/14/2016 AVA 1 . 1cm , without symptoms
- probably needs routine echos in future to monitor progression , will let her PCP know
- we discussed s / s severe AS and she has none current and will watch out for these in future
History of C difficile colitis , unknown chronology .
Obstructive sleep apnea , uses CPAP intermittently at home but declines use here
Chronic renal insufficiency due to Adriamycin , probably stage 2-3 , creatinine 0.9 here
Rosacea .
Osteoarthritis .
Vitamin B12 deficiency .
Protein calorie malnutrition , hypoalbuminemia
Anemia .
Anxiety , appropriate for situation
Insomnia , is open to trying melatonin
Low-density lesions in the liver seen on CT scan , for outpt follo - up

RECOMMENDATIONS :

- note INR of 1.7 this morning ; consider 1 u FFP before case or run in just prior to OR time ( please check with blood bank given her antibodies ; I don 't think this should affect FFP but would check in with them )

- HOLD full dose anticoagulation for at least 48-72 hours after surgery ; 72 hours would be better from post-op bleeding risk perspective ; during this time , use heparin sc 5000 u tid for prophylaxis ( not treatment ) dose

- once she is ready for full dose anticoagulation , consider heparin gtt rather than enoxaparin , which is easier to 'turn off ' if she ends up having post-op oozing / bleeding , and resuming warfarin as well to allow this to trend up INR ( warfarin can be resumed as soon as she is tolerating oral meds , and you feel comfortable from surg perspective )

- note that she declines CPAP for napping / sleeping though she does have OSA ; please use nasal cannula oxygen at night at 2 lpm , plus O2 sat monitoring while asleep for respiratory monitoring safety


- Please order TED hose for her immediately post-op and continue , to help with lymphedema

- I will touch base with her PCP today ; they would like to be linked back up with Dr . Gallagher for discharge follow-up and updates

- once she gets through surgery , THEN OK to start pharmacy equivalent of fluvastatin 40 mg nightly ( not on our formulary )
- she would like to try melantonin to help with insomnia , which is reasonable to try once we get her through the proposed surgery today
