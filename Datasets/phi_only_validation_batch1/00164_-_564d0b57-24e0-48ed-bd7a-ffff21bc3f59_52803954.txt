PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
- hypertension
- CKD stage III , baseline Cr 1.2-1.6 , possibly secondary to chemotherapy
- AML a summary of the patient 's diagnostic and treatment history is provided courtesy of Heather Smith 's clinic note dated 3/24/17 :
" 1 .

Diagnosed with AML in December 2012 , NPM1 positive , FLT3 negative . She had a preceding 5 - month history of worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion and some epistaxis . A bone marrow on 12/05/2012 , confirmed AML with 38 % blasts by morphology , 44 % by flow cytometry , normal cytogenetics by standard metaphase testing . However , I - FISH testing revealed 4 of 300 cells with trisomy 8 of unclear significance . At that time , her TRM score was quite low , and she was treated with standard 7 + 3 plus ATRA on 12/27/2012 . She achieved remission after her first cycle .

2 .

She went on to receive consolidation chemotherapy with Ara-C with 400 mg / sq m on days 1 through 5 with ATRA 30 mg daily in divided doses on days 3 through 28 , with cycle # 2 on 03/12/2013 and cycle # 3 on 04/18/2013 . A bone marrow aspiration obtained on 05/20/2013 revealed a normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and no evidence of leukemia by morphology or flow cytometry . Cytogenetics confirmed normal standard cytogenetics as well as negative I FISH . NPM1 testing was negative as well .

3 . Relapsed AML , confirmed in October 2015 . Induction Dactinomycin 12.5 mcg/kg IV daily x 5 days administered 10/16/15 . Her post chemotherapy course complicated by severe mucositis requiring hospital admission for IV fluids and IV narcotics . Bone marrow obtained on 11/18/2015 was hypercellular with trilineage hematopoiesis and 3.5 % blasts noted by morphology , 0.4 % by flow cytometry , consistent with CR and MRD . Cytogenetics reveal normal female cells with no evidence of an abnormal trisomy 8 by FISH testing .
4 . Dactinomycin cycle # 2 , 6.25 mcg/kg IV daily x 5 days administered 12/1/15 ( dose reduced by 50 % because of prior toxicities ) . Patient tolerated chemotherapy well without significant toxicities . bone marrow obtained on 12/28/2015 reveals approximately 2 % blasts by morphology , 1.2 % by flow cytometry , consistent with a complete remission with MRD .
5 . Dactinomycin cycle # 3 , 9 mcg/kg IV daily x 5 days ( 75 % of original induction dose ) administered 1/4/16 .
6 . ARA-C cycle # 1 x 5 days D1 2/15/16
7 . ARA-C cycle # 2 x 5 days D1 3/7/2016 Bone marrow from 04/26/2016 is patchy normocellular trilineage hematopoiesis without morphologic or immunophenotypic evidence of AML . Cytogenetics revealed normal FISH testing consistent with remission . However , NPM1 testing in her bone marrow was positive at 0.008 % .
8 . ARA-C cycle # 3 x 5 days , administered on 5/2/16
9 . ARA-C cycle # 4 x 5 days , administered on 6/11/16
10 . ARA-C cycle # 5 x 5 days , administered on 7/13/16
11 . A bone marrow 8 / 2016 revealed MRD with a normocellular marrow without morphologic evidence of AML , however , 0.12 % blasts by flow cytometry . She was followed with surveillance labs . By Feb 2017 , she noted profound fatigue and CBC revealed anemia with Hct 15 % with circulating blasts . She opted to enroll on clinical research study 9247 , with drug sensitivity testing revealing sensitivity to Ara - C .
12 . Induction chemotherapy with " mini " GCLAM 3/8/17 . "

- chemo orders per Estey .
- TLS / DIC labs q8 once chemo starts
- CBC q day
- not currently neutropenic , so holding ppx at this time
