ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Ms. Williams is a 59 year old female with stage IIa , T2N0M0 invasive ductal breast carcinoma , ER / PR neg , Her2Nu positive in 20 % of cells , status post lumpectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy including herceptin that had to be discontinued early secondary to cardiotoxicity , presenting for routine 6 month follow - up . Ms. Williams is doing well without complaints or symptoms of metastatic disease or post - chemotherapy toxicity .

She does have some scar tissue in the left breast below the nipple which is consistent with fibrosis . Her mammogram today was negative .

She will have her labs sent to me when they are done .

I encouraged her to continue with regular exercise and healthy eating , as she has been doing .

She will return to see me in 6 months , and will be due for a bilateral mammogram at that time .
