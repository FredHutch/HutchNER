ASSESSMENT & PLAN
Ms. Ball is a 24 yo F with AML , history of neutropenic fever and seizures admitted for second cycle of CLAG consolidation chemotherapy .

# . Acute myelogenous leukemia : Consolidation chemotherapy Day3 ( D1 = 10 / 8 ) with CLAG s/p filgrastim priming . Pt is FLT3 + and has translocation of 6 ; 11 and deletion of 9 . Pt 's WBC count is reflection of GCSF , and TLS and DIC labs remain unremarkable .
- CLAG : Filgrastim subcutaneously days 0-5 , cladribine days 1-5 , and cytarabine IV days 1-5 ( 25 % reduction ) .
- Prophylaxis : Allopurinol 300 mg qD , acyclovir 800 mg BID , Posaconazole 200 mg TID , Levaquin 750 mg qHS .
- Antiemetics per powerplan + scopolamine patch
- TLS and DIC labs qD
- IVF per powerplan
- Transfusion thresholds plt 10 , hct 26

# . Seizures : Does not have a dx of epilepsy , but talking with neurology this AM , there is concern that pt 's episodes could be epileptiform in nature , and the bil involvement could represent generalized activity even without LE involvement .
- Neurology following , appreciate recs
- Increase Keppra to 1500 mg q12hr ( if nauseated convert keppra to IV ; same dose )
- Spot EEG today
- LP under fluoro today , with administration of IT cytarabine per Dr. Becker
- Ativan if seizure > 2 min

# Low back pain and weakness : pt has long hx and sounds like worsens with intense mood and deconditioning . Has some elements of neuropathic involvement with shooting sensation down bil legs to mid thigh area . She has hx of " slipped discs " , reports not having any prior back / spine imaging . Pt is morbidly obese as well as markedly deconditioned for a woman of her age . Her weakness can be further worsening her LBP . As far as etiology of weakness , seems to have started around when AML was diagnosed , now using a walker or wheelchair and with slow gait , possibly ataxic altho difficult to tell w / walker assistance . Again concern for chemo toxicity , but also could be severe deconditioning from severe illness induced myopathy when pt in ICU in September 2014 .
- Consider starting gabapentin 300 mg qHS
- PT/OT

# . Memory deficits : Unclear etiology at this time . Ddx includes iatrogenic / toxic from medications , possible post-ictal state as well as PTSD . Most likely this is a chemotherapy side effect , and hope memory clears with time . Further evaluation of seizures as above , but keppra can also cause a sedation - like state , although mild , which could contribute . Pt does not have hx of PTSD , but this is also known to cause memory deficits .
- CTM

# . Diarrhea : likely chemo related or IBS as pt having difficulties with anxiety and mood lately . C diff negative 10 / 09 .
- Loperamide prn

# . Adjustment disorder with anxiety : pt followed by psychologist as outpt . Diagnosed after AML ,
- Sertraline

Lines : L PICC
DVT ppx : lovenox until platelets < 50
