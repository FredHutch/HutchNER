Problems / Assessment / Plan
73 / F with new diagnosis of AML and hyperbilirubinemia admitted to UWMC for work-up and induction chemotherapy with FLAG . Coarse complicated by respiratory failure , concern for sepsis , AMS , acute kidney injury , possible TLS and acute bleed .

# NEURO :
- Has been on fentanyl boluses only ; rc 'd total of 50 mcg of fentanyl overnight and continues to be somnolent this morning . Intact neurologic reflexes ; does not localize to pain .
- Given prolonged somnolent state despite stopping fentanyl and versed gtts w / thrombocytopenia . Head CT ruled out concern for brain bleed , however , revealed concern for possible mastoiditis . Consulting ID for further help with further management .

# PULMONARY : ARDS
- bilateral alveolar infiltrates which likely represent extravasation for the capillaries in setting of chemo initiation . This is what has likely led to her increased O2 requirement . She is however at a high risk for sepsis immunocompromised state .
- Continue low tidal ventilation .
- Did increase fi02 and PEEP requirements overnight ; CXR stable . Slight increase in secretions .
- Will consider bronchscopy this afternoon given source of bleed is not abdominal .

# ) SIRS / concern for sepsis
- meets SIRS criteria and likely has infection perhaps septic shock as cause of hypotension as ECHO 1 / 15 was negative for heart failure , however , continues to have NGTD .

# ID :
- Culture data NGTD .
- Vancomycin discontinued yesterday due to negative culture data and in the setting of progressively worsening acute kidney injury . In the event , pt were to become hemodynamically unstable , would add back vanco .
- Continue imipenem which was started on 1 / 15 ; plan to continue until counts return .
- Azithromycin x 5 day course started 1 / 15 with planned stop date of 1/20/13 .
- Will follow up with ID regarding further recs for mastoiditis as previously discussed .
- Started and stopped olsetamiver 1 / 15 once lab data negative .
- Continue on fungal and viral ppx as less likely causes of her decompensation given lack of neutropenia : acyclovir 400 mg tid , fluconazole 200 mg qday

# CARDIO : Afib
- - New onset afib with HR 140 s likely related to acute blood loss / bleed .
- - Troponins negative , no ST changes on EKG . Potassium low at 3.6 ; phosph high at 7.4 .
- - Rc 'd dilt boluses x3 today , followed by dilt gtt for rate control . Goal HR < 110 .

# RENAL : AKI
- Cr elevated at 2.46 ; admission Cr 0.86 . Rapid increase over the last 36 hours .
- Ddx for AKI includes pre-renal and intra-renal causes including hypotension , contrast , possible ATN , chemotherapy toxicities and possible TLS . Etiology likely multifactorial .
- FENA 0.2 % yesterday . Ur sodium 10 suggesting pre - renal .
- UA revealed casts .
- Limit nephrotoxins ; medications renally adjusted and fludarbine chemotherapy held in the setting of AKI .
- Appreciate renal consulting .

# FEN :
- Hyperphosphatemia secondary to acute kidney injury . Starting phosphate binder today .
- Continue TF .

# Hyperbilirubinemia :
Initial Hem Onc concern had been for obstruction in biliary tree however , her mrcp was normal and her LFTs are elvated to stable most likely infiltration of the liver by her monocytes - leukemia . GI consulted and appreciate recs
- FLAG initiated and LFTs improving with chemotherapy supporting infiltration .
- daily LFTs ; downtrending this morning .
- Hep B is not immune however given her immune status do not believe she would respond approrpriately to a vaccine at this time therefore will need future vaccination . hep A pending

# Constipation :
- - On colace , adding senna and prn biscodyl supp .
- - Last BM 1 / 13 . Negative for blood .

# Oncology :
AML , M3 to M4 with predominant monocyte and premyelocyte with 44 % blast on marrow . Inv16 positive . FLAG regimen for initiation . Will continue at request of oncology service
- Continue ARA-C per Oncology team . Stopping fludarbine secondary to AKI as previously discussed .
- Contintue q8hr TLS labs . Uric acid decreased post rasburicase administration yesterday . Will continue allopurinol .

# Hematology :
- - Acute blood loss of unclear etiology . ABD bleed ruled out with CT , head bleed ruled out with head CT . While sputum is blood streaked , no frank blood noted . No evidence of bleeding from orifices noted on exam .
- - While she is tachycardiac , she has not been hypotensive .
- - Will consider bronchscopy this afternoon to rule out DAH .
- - Will transfuse for HCT > 26 and plts ~ 100

# DM :
- On insulin gtt with goal BG 100-180 .

Stable problems :
# GERD : omeprazole via NG
# Tremor : continue primidone
# Thyroid nodule
Incidental finding on CT .
- Given her 3 different primary cancers , she will need FNA as an outpatient for further work up .

# # ) Onc
- Heme : Thresholds 26 % and 100 K
- Prophylaxis : NA
- Immunosupression : NA
# # ) T / L / D : PICC line , Port , L art line , foley catheter , ET tube , OG tube
# # ) Prophylaxis :
- DVT : SCD ( plts < 50 therefore no SQ heparin )
