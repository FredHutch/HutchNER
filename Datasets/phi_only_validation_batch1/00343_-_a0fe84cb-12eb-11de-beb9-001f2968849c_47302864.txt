HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presents for admission for scheduled consolidation chemotherapy # 1 with HiDAC for his relapsed AML , isolated to the CNS with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis s/p induction chemo with G - CLAM ( d1 4/23/16 ) and 6 doses of IT chemo . He had initially presented with sever Neuro symptoms including cauda equina like symptoms ( saddle anesthesia , numbness and weakness in bilateral LE , back pain ) , neuropathic pain , and intermittent extremity tremor episodes . Since he started chemo , all of these symptoms have been improving . His last tremor episode was Saturday 5 / 28 and he had to lower himself to the ground . He denies injury or LOC . He reports these episodes have greatly decreased in frequency and severity . He tolerated the induction cycle well . He denied issues with nausea or appetite . He did have some constipation , which improved with docusate and PRN senna .

He continues to have mid and lower back pain , which is usually well controlled on BID oxycontin and PRN oxycodone , which he usually only takes 1-2 doses a day . He reports that the pain has been a little worse the last couple days . His neuropathic pain , for which he takes Lyrica , has greatly improved in the last week .

He had an Omaya placed 5 / 31 . He states that there is some mild tenderness at the site , but denies headache or signs of infection . He has recently noticed that his face and neck are puffier than usual . He thinks maybe it is related to eating salt in his diet . He denies LE edema . He also reported that 2 days ago he passed a kidney stone , which he saws is a chronic issue for him since 2003 . He denies any dysuria today . The patient reports that he feels well today and he is ready to start this chemotherapy cycle .
