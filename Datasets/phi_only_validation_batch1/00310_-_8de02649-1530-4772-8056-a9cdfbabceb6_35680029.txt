ASSESSMENT & PLAN
54 yo woman with AML s/p induction with 7 + 3 + hedgehog inhibitor ( Day 1 = 4 / 3 ) who is admitted with neutropenic fever thought secondary to enteritis , course complicated by persistent fevers , rash , and SVT .

# Neutropenic fever :
Source is most likely enteritis / gut translocation given presenting symptoms and CT findings . However , all blood cultures , urine cultures , skin biopsy cultures , stool cultures , stool O & P , C diff testing remain negative thus far . Patient was having persistent fevers despite coverage with vancomycin / meropenem , so metronidazole and micafungin were added , but vancomycin was discontinued 4 / 26 without significant change . Persistently overnight fever . The onset correlated with return of neutrophil counts , and ANC is now > 500 . It is very difficult to determine which anti - microbial , if any , were effective as all culture data has remained negative .
- - High Resolution CT w / o contrast Chest to evaluate for fungal nodules or atypical infection
- - If no pulmonary infection discontinue meropenem ( 4 / 17 - present )
- - transition from IV to PO metronidazole ( 4 / 23 - present )
- - continue micafungin ( 4 / 24 - present )
- - f/u serum galactomannan
- - f/u stool culture , O & P
- - f/u biopsy cultures as below
- - f/u urine and blood cultures ( both here and Valley )

# Rash
Unclear etiology , differential diagnosis includes Sweet 's syndrome , drug rash , erythema nodosum , fungal infection . Final pathology likely to be back on Monday .
- appreciate dermatology consult
- follow-up biopsy / culture results
- sutures to be removed on approx 5 / 5

# Acute Kidney Injury
Possibly prerenal secondary to significant diarrhea / volume depletion , though persistent creatinine elevation 1.23-1.4 during hospital course . Concomittant rash raises possibility of AIN , though UA and urine eos not suggestive . Patient continues with good urine output , Cr showing mild improvement .
- maintian euvolemia , bolus IV fluids as necessary

# AML
Molecular studies neg ( FLT3 , NPM1 , and CEBPA ) , cytogenetics 46 XX , FISH normal . S/p induction chemotherapy with 7 + 3 ( day 1 = 4 / 3 ) , now showing some count recovery . Continues on hedgehog inhibitor study drug as per protocol .
- continue hedgehog inhibitor study drug

- patient to be NPO 2 hours prior and post
- transfusion thresholds : Hct < 26 , Plts < 10
- Repeat bone marrow Day 26-28

# SVT :
Patient has been experiencing intermittent runs of SVT , which appear to include multifocal atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation . Tend to occur with activity and fevers . Has remained with stable BP during episodes .
- continue telemetry
- continue increased metoprolol to 25 mg PO Q6hours

- plan to convert to succinate prior to discharge once on stable dose
- keep K > 4.0 , Mg > 2.0
- continue to bolus fluids as necessary for infection

# Diarrhea :
Improving . Most likely related to chemo toxicity . Cdiff neg , stool culture and O & P remain pending . Improvement with return of neutrophils , patient now tolerating full diet .
- - Loperamide PRN
- - f/u stool studies

FEN : immunosupressed diet
T / L / D : L PICC , R PIV
VTE prophylaxis : SCDs and ambulation
Contacts : Husband Jonathan 206-240 - 7941 , Daughter Bethany 206-853 - 7160
Code status : FULL
Discharge plan : pending resolution of neutropenia / fevers , possibly on 4 / 28



ATTENDING STATEMENT :
I personally saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Stewart 's note .
Additional diagnoses : none .
