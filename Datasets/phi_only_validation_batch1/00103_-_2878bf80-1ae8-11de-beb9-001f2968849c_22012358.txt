IDENTIFICATION
Kay Bartlett is a 69 - year - old female with a history of T3 , N2 resected and treated colon cancer and a newly diagnosed pancreas cancer , s/p Whipple procedure by Dr. Pillaresetty at UWMC on September 8 , 2011 . She is seen in clinic prior to chemo to assess for toxicities and check her labs .

CURRENT TREATMENT
1 .
Gemcitabine 1000 mg / m ( 2 ) day 1 , 8 and 15 every 28 days .

Today is cycle 1 , day 15 .

TREATMENT HISTORY
1 .
10/02/2002 : Diagnosed with colon cancer in Anchorage , Alaska . This was resected later the same month and was staged as a T3 , N2 ( 5 of 12 lymph nodes positive for metastases ) , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis propria . Surgical margins were negative .

2 .
October 2002 to May 2003 : NSABPC - 07 clinical trial , randomized to the Rosswell Park bolus 5FU - leucovorin arm without oxaliplatin . CA1 9-9 level rose from 57 to 123 . Removed from the study .

3 .
June 2003 : Consultation at MD Anderson Cancer Center with Dr. Lin . Restaging CT confirmed the presence of a paraaortic mass consistent with recurrent colon cancer .

4 .
June 2003 : Patient enrolled in the phase I study exploring CPT11 ( irinotecan ) and PTK - 787 ( an ImClone - produced antiangiogenic agent ) with partial response in the retroperitoneal node . Mrs . Bartlett developed a grade 4 transaminitis which required discontinuation of the study medication . However , her CA1 9-9 normalized .

5 .
December 2003 : Consolidative chemoradiation treatment with capecitabine and celecoxib . This continued into January 2004 .

6 .
January 2004 to July 2007 : Maintenance capecitabine plus celecoxib regimen . The treatment was well tolerated except for developing osteoporosis .

7 .
July 2007 to August 30 , 2011 : Surveillance on single - agent Celebrex , and later on baby aspirin 5 days on and 2 days off .

8 . August 30 , 2011 . Found to have a new pancreas head mass and rising CA1 9-9 tumor marker . Staging studies to determine whether recurrence of colon cancer vs . new pancreas primary found likelihood of pancreas primary .

9 .
September 9 , 2011 . Taken to surgery by Venu Pillaresetty , MD at UWMC for a Whipple procedure that was complicated a bit by the intense fibrotic reaction to earlier surgery and chemo - radiation . This led to an extended resection of the body of the pancreas fairly far to the left . Post op pathology was confirmatory for pancreas cancer . No nodal involvement . Some vascular invasion was present .

10 .
October 6 , 2011 to present . Single agent gemcitabine . Grade 3 neutropenia by day 8 of first cycle .

INTERVAL HISTORY
Kay is seen today for day 15 of cycle 1 of gemcitabine . Chemo was held last week for asymptomatic neutropenia . She was given a 5 - day course of prophylactic antibiotics , which she completed .
