ASSESSMENT & PLAN :
Mrs . Xu is a 53 yo woman on D12 of induction chemo w / CPX - 351 for secondary AML , which was complicated by ileitis and GII mucositis

# Therapy related AML
Thought 2 / 2 ovarian cancer chemotherapy . Flow showed 53 % blasts ; FLT3 , CEBPA , NPM1 negative ; cytogenetics showed 47 , XX , +8 , t ( 16 ; 21 ) ( q24 ; q22 ) [ 20 ] . Admitted for CPX - 351 chemotherapy , started 10 / 10 ; she 's completed her initial cycle . Oscillating monocytosis , might be from disease given previous Monocytosis at diagnosis . Further BM will be probably at counts recovery or D28 , might be antecipated if monocytosis remains tredning up
- Pancytopenic 2 / 2 chemo , didn 't need tx today . Moderate neutropenia . Threshold HCT < 26 Plt < 10 K
- Monocytosis , if persistent might be sign of her disease . Given lipossomal chemo might takes a longer time to disease control .
- Threshold HCT < 26 Plt < 10 K
- Infectious Ppx : acyclovir , no longer on antifungal as not severly neutropenic

# Ileitis : afebrile x72hr , abdominal pain resolved and BCx NGTD , on Cipro and Metronidazol
- Cipro and Metronidazol PO throug 10 / 26
- Will f/u BCx

# Chemo toxicity

- Mucositis GII on NS rinse and on Morphine ER 15 mg Q12hr

- Nausea well controlled on Zofran PRN , however given HA will switch to Prochlorperazine .


# Headaches . Likely from Ondansetron . No neuro findings and plt never belowe 5 K , so unlikely to be CNS hematoma .
- Will monitor , if worsens consider head CT scan w / o to rule out CNS hematoma

# Diarrhea , intermittent , likely from antibiotics . Another possibility is chemo toxicity .
- Will monitor

Left leg fractures
Pt has 4 LE fractures 2 / 2 falls , which seem to be mechanical in nature .
- Continue PT while inpatient
- Continue pain regimen w / MS contin
- per ortho : non-weight bearing on the LLE for total of 2-3 months from surgery , ROM at L knee . As tolerated with weight bearing on R , remain in CAM boot , okay to remove for shower . Will need repeat x-rays in 3-4 weeks , if still inpatient , contact ortho then to review and determine weight bearing status

Dry eyes : was having " wavy " and blurry vision , ophtho consulted and said she had dry eyes
- optho recommended artificial tears

FENGI : clear liquids , ADAT .
