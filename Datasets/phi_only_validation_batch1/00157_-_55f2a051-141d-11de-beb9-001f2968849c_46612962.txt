ASSESSMENT & PLAN :

72 yo woman s/p revision of colostomy and repair of peristomal hernia

Chronic left lower extremity DVT with venous stents placed in 2013 ; history of line assoc dvt in past
- anticoagulation with warfarin at home , enoxaparin bridge here
- reasonable to resume warfarin once bowel function 'wakes up ' , continue enoxaparin until INR is at goal 2-3

Moderate aortic stenosis , on TTE 4/14/2016 AVA 1 . 1cm , without symptoms
- probably needs routine echos in future to monitor progression , will let her PCP know
- we discussed s / s severe AS and she has none current and will watch out for these in future

History of leiomyosarcoma status post chemoradiation and surgical resection .
Chronic rectal pain and fecal urgency .
Peristomal hernia with recent small bowel obstruction .
History of tubulovillous and tubular adenoma of the colon .
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease .
Cervical spine stenosis .
History of decreased EF chemotherapy toxicity in past , no e / o CHF now
History of C difficile colitis , unknown chronology .
Obstructive sleep apnea , uses CPAP intermittently at home but declines use here
Chronic renal insufficiency due to Adriamycin , probably stage 2-3 , creatinine 0.9 here
Rosacea .
Osteoarthritis .
Vitamin B12 deficiency .
Protein calorie malnutrition , hypoalbuminemia
Anemia .
Anxiety , appropriate for situation
Insomnia , is open to trying melatonin
Low-density lesions in the liver seen on CT scan , for outpt follo - up

RECOMMENDATIONS :

- resume warfarin at home dose as above , as soon as she has clear return of bowel function

- continue enoxaparin 'bridge ' at current therapeutic dose until INR is 2-3

- Please order TED hose for her immediately post-op and continue , to help with lymphedema

- Please obtain a weight

- I have touched base with her PCP Dr. Tom Gallagher and will do so again closer to discharge follow-up and updates

- upon discharge , resume fluvastatin 40 mg nightly ( not on our formulary )

- she would like to try melantonin to help with insomnia , which is reasonable to try once her bowels are moving
