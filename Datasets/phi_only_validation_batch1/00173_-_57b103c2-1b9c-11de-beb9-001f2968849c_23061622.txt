Intraoperative findings - scar tissue in the mesentery but no palpable nodularity in the omentum or surface of the liver . Two metastatic nodules in the subhepatic space were adherent to the retroperitoneum and liver and were removed completely .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
1 .
Chemotherapy . Based on her ECOG of 0 and her labs , she can receive chemo today .
2 .
Continue supportive meds , vitamins , and healthy diet . We discussed her activity level and I encouraged her to continue regular exercise and full life . She currently receives massage therapy and finds this helpful for chemo toxicities and energy levels . I provided her with a prescription for regular treatments .

FOLLOW-UP
Restaging CT scan scheduled for 1 / 9 and followup visit with Dr. Whiting on 1 / 11 . Chemo scheduled into February .
