IDENTIFICATION
Vanessa Jensen is a 56 - year - old female with multiply - recurrent stage IV K - RAS mutation positive G12D colon cancer involving the liver , lungs , and abdominal wall , originally diagnosed in April 2007 . She is currently being treated with FOLFIRI chemotherapy and is seen prior to infusion for assessment and lab review .

CURRENT TREATMENT
FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab every 2 weeks .

Today is cycle 10 day 1 ( although has received multiple cycles in the past ) .

TREATMENT HISTORY
1 .
April 10 , 2007 . Ms. Jensen was taken to surgery at an outside institution for what was thought to be ovarian cancer . She had a TAH / BSO but was unexpectedly found to have a cecal cancer . She thus also underwent resection of the terminal ileum and cecum in addition to the TAH / BSO . Her CEA was 32 at the time of her surgery .
2 .
Following surgery , she was treated ( also on the outside ) with twelve cycles of FOLFOX plus bevacizumab , although oxaliplatin was held during the final three cycles because of severe neuropathy .
3 .
Surveillance . CT scans had remained negative . However , after a baseline low CEA of 2 , it rose to 8.4 .
4 .
July 29 , 2008 . Transferred care to the SCCA where she first saw Dr. Back . Path review at UWMC showed moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma , 2 x 1 cm in dimension , extending through the muscularis propria into the pericolic fat , and infiltrating into the submucosa of the adjacent terminal ileum . There was no angiolymphatic invasion . 5 of 19 pericolic lymph nodes were positive . The ovaries were both positive for metastatic adenocarcinoma , consistent with colorectal primary . The uterus and fallopian tubes were negative .
A CT scan on 08/08/2008 showed multiple focal intraperitoneal lesions consistent with peritoneal neoplastic implants .
5 .
August 26 , 2008 to February 17 , 2009 . FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab . 12 cycles . MRI of the abdomen done on February 26 , 2009 show stable , but residual , peritoneal disease .
6 .
June 17 , 2009 . Debulking surgery with HIPEC ( mitomycin - C 26 mg , doxorubicin 26 mg , and IV 5 - FU / leukovorin ) by Dr. Paul Sugarbaker in Washington DC . Recovery from surgery was rough , due to delayed wound healing and pain .
7 .
July 17 , 2009 to January 26 , 2010 . Surveillance . Rising CEA in absence of CT findings .
8 .
January 26 , 2010 to July 26 , 2010 . FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab . 12 cycles .
9 . July 27 , 2010 to September 20 , 2010 . Xeloda plus bevacizumab . Capecitabine dosed at 1000mg / m2 ( 1500 mg QAM and 1500 mg QPM ) Day 1-14 every 3 weeks . 3 cycles .
10 .
September 21 , 2010 to January 14 , 2011 . Surveillance . Rising CEA , LLQ tenderness , and PET scan uptake .
11 .
January 14 , 2011 to April 5 , 2011 . FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab . 6 cycles on Jan . 14 , Feb 08 , Feb 22 , Mar 08 , Mar 22 , and April 05 . Bevacizumab was held on Jan 14 , March 22 , and April 05 , 2011 .
12 .
May 3 , 2011 . Debulking surgery with HIPEC by Dr. Jesus Esquival at St . Agnes Hospital in Baltimore .
13 .
May 4 , 2011 to October 25 , 2011 . Post op healing and surveillance . Gradually rising CEA and some of the characteristic " twinges and electrical 'zaps ' " that she has had in the past when the cancer is active . CEA still in normal area and PET scan initially inconclusive . Tender nodules later appeared at bottom of abdominal scar and in rectovaginal area ( acc by vag bleeding ) .
14 .
October 25 , 2011 to February 28 , 2012 . FOLFIRI with and without bevacizumab . 10 cycles . Bevacizumab was initially held out of concern of potential vaginal fistula and was added to regimen starting cycle 4 . Leukovorin was held for cycles 7-9 due to a national shortage .
15 .
March 1 , 2012 to July 23 , 2012 . Surveillance . Increasing symptoms ( abdominal pain ) with progression seen on CT / PET scanning caused return to treatment .
16 .
July 24 , 2012 - June 2013 . FOLFIRI with bevacizumab .
17 .
July 8 , 2013 - December 24 , 2013 : FOLFOX with bevacizumab .
17 .
December 22 through January 9 , 2014 : Radiation therapy to painful anterior abdominal wall mass .
18 .
February 11 , 2014 : Short treatment with regorafib chemotherapy ; discontinued due to bone pain and toxicities .
19 .
March 11 , 2014 : Re-initiation of FOLFIRI plus Avastin .

INTERVAL HISTORY
Vanessa is seen today prior to infusion . She has been experiencing slightly more frequent episodes of epigastric abdominal pain that leads to vomiting of bilious emesis . These have been occuring after each of the past three cycles , typically on her off week . Most recent episode was yesterday , about 3 hours after eating breakfast . Abdominal pain resolves after vomiting . Bowel function has not changed , and continues to fluctuate between soft and firm . Not currently on a regular bowel regimen . Weight has been slowly trending down over the past few months and she attributes this to her abdominal pain / vomiting . She is remaining active with art projects , family , friends , and attending a wedding over the weekend . She thinks she may have broken her right small toe after stubbing it a few days ago .

She denies fevers , chills , respiratory symptoms , rectal bleeding , melena , rash , mouth sores .

ECOG performance status is 1 .

ASSESSMENT / PLAN
1 .
Treatment . ECOG performance status is 1 and labs are stable . We will proceed with chemo as scheduled .
2 .
Abdominal cramping , chemo toxicity vs . constipation . Unclear cause , although symptoms are gradually progressing . Will discuss restaging plans with Dr. Back . For now , will start on a regular bowel regimen including senna and docusate . Rx also provided for Reglan to take before meals as needed to ipmrove nausea and gastric emptying . Continue oxycodone to use as needed .
3 .
FEN . Weight gradually decreasing over the past few months , likely secondary to abdominal discomfort . She will be meeting with SCCA nutritionist later today . Again suggested use of papaya enzymes to aid in digestion . Continue to monitor and support .
4 .
History of PE . INR is 1.4 today . She will contact SCCA Anticoagulation Clinic after our visit today .
5 .
Toe injury . X-ray obtained today shows no evidence of fracture . Recommend continued elevation , icing as needed .

Follow up . Scheduled to RTC on 8 / 5 for a visit with Claire Stockhausen , PA-C , prior to infusion .
