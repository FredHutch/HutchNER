Ms. Gines is a 40 - year - old female with history of recently diagnosed stage IIA , ER + / PR + / HER2 - negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . She is status post right breast wire localized lumpectomy and right axillary SLN biopsy done in 04 / 2015 . She started adjuvant Q 3 week Taxotere and Cytoxan on 05/18/2015 and has received 2 cycles to date . She is here today for chemotherapy toxicity evaluation and follow - up .


PROBLEM LIST :
1 . Breast Cancer : Ms. Gines initially presented with a self - detected right breast mass in 01 / 2015 . Follow-up bilateral diagnostic mammogram and unilateral right US were done on 01/27/2015 with the mammogram showing a negative left breast ; and to the right breast , a mass at 5:00 , measuring 2.3 cm . US showed a solid mass at 5:00 , 2 cm from the nipple measuring 2.0 x 2.6 x 1.3 cm , at the site ofmammographic and clinically palpable mass ; and a normal intramammary lymph node at 10:00 , 9 cm from the nipple . The patient postponed further evaluation including recommended biopsy until 03 / 2015 . On 03/05/2015 , an US-guided core needle biopsy with clip placement was done of the 5:00 right breast mass . The pathology showed invasive ductal carcinoma with mucinous and solid papillary features , Nottingham grade 2 , ER + / PR + ( both with Allred scores of 8 / 8 ) , HER2 - negative , no associated DCIS or lymphatic invasion present . Bilateral breast MRI on 03/12/2015 showed to the right breast an irregular enhancing mass measuring 1.7 x 2.1 x 2.2 cm at 5-6 o 'clock , which corresponded to the previously biopsied cancer . There was a clip artifact within the mass . The left breast was negative . Ms. Gines initially met with Dr. Michelle Yao and Dr. Andrew Jacobs at Virginia Mason Medical Center for treatment recommendations . She then sought a second opinion at the SCCA BCSC on 03/27/2015 and eventually decided to establish oncologic care at the SCCA .
Ms. Gines had right breast wire localized lumpectomy and a right axillary SLN biopsy done on 04/08/2015 by Dr. Sara Javid . Pathology showed invasive ductal carcinoma measuring 2.1 cm , grade 2 , ER + ( Allred score 8 / 8 ) , PR + ( Allred score 8 / 8 ) , HER2 - negative by IHC , associated DCIS of high nuclear grade with necrosis , no angiolymphatic space invasion identified ; and 1 / 1 right axillary SLN negative for metastatic carcinoma . Final pathologic stage was pT2pN0MX .
Oncotype DX recurrence score was 31 , correlating with a 10 - year risk of distant breast cancer recurrence of 21 % with use of tamoxifen alone . Ms. Gines started adjuvant Taxotere 75 mg / m2 and Cytoxan 600 mg / m2 given Q 3 weeks on 05/18/2015 and has received 2 of 4 planned cycles to date .

IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
Ms. Gines is a 40 - year - old premenopausal female with newly diagnosed stage IIA invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast , which ER + / PR + / HER2 - negative . She is status post right lumpectomy and right SLN biopsy . She is currently receiving adjuvant chemotherapy with Taxotere and Cytoxan given Q 3 weeks and has completed 2 cycles . She is scheduled to receive cycle # 3 today . Today , Ms. Gines looks well clinically and is tolerating the TC chemotherapy fairly well . She is having expected hand - foot toxicity , scalp follliculitis , generalized alopecia , nausea , taste bud changes , generalized neulasta - related bone pain / aches all of which appear to be grade 1-2 on physical exam and ROS . Her labs show adequate WBC / ANC and platelets . She is noted to have mild anemia which predates her cancer diagnosis . Her LFTs and chemistry panel are within normal limits . I reviewed all of the above with Ms. Gines and explained that these toxicities / side - effects are expected with TC and I assured her that we will continue to follow her and the TC associated toxicity closely . I have instructed her to start taking the ranitidine twice per day on a regular basis to alleviate GERD and associated nausea . She is to continue the ranitidine until after 4 weeks after completing her last dose of TC . Lastly , Ms. Gines brings with her a list with numerous questions regarding ongoing / future treatment plans which she was hoping to discuss today . I explained to Ms. Gines that was no extra time allotted on my clinic schedule to do this today . As they are not of an urgent matter , I recommended making a 60 minute appointment for her next follow-up visit at which time we could go her questions / issues to which she agrees .
PLAN
1 . Continue Taxotere 75 mg / m2 and Cytoxan 600 mg / m2 IV Q 3 weeks . TC cycle # 3 is scheduled for today
