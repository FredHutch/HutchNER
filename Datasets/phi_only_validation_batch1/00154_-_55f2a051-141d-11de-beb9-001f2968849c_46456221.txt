History of leiomyosarcoma status post chemoradiation and surgical resection .
Chronic rectal pain and fecal urgency .
Peristomal hernia with recent small bowel obstruction .
History of tubulovillous and tubular adenoma of the colon .
Hiatal hernia with gastroesophageal reflux disease .

Chronic renal insufficiency due to Adriamycin , her most recent creatinine in the normal range .

Osteoarthritis .
Vitamin B12 deficiency .
Protein calorie malnutrition , hypoalbuminemia
Anemia .
Systolic murmur , probably aortic sclerosis , no no symptoms concerning for severe aortic stenosis
Anxiety , appropriate for situation
Insomnia , is open to trying melatonin

RECOMMENDATIONS :
- Transthoracic echo today ( to evaluate systolic murmur , LV and RV cardiac funtion )
- Recheck WBC and INR prior to procedure ( today or early tomorrow AM )
- Last dose of enoxaparin should be given 24 h or more prior to surgery ( hold after this AM 's dose if considering surgery tomorrow )
- she declines CPAP for napping / sleeping " too many wires on me already "
- please use nasal cannula oxygen at night at 2 lpm , plus O2 sat monitoring while asleep for safety
- she is pretty anxious about the plan for the next few days and would benefit from some TLC , supportive discussion about plan with her husband present , emotional support ( I will keep checking in with her as well ! )

- once she gets through surgery , THEN OK to start pharmacy equivalent of fluvastatin 40 mg nightly ( not on our formulary )
- she would like to try melantonin to help with insomnia , perhaps once we get her through the proposed surgery
