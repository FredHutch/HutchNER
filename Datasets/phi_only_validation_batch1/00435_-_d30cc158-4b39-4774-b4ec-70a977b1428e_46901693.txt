INTERVAL HISTORY
First week of treatment is bad ; second week is good . Hard to think it’s worthwhile to continue chemo when every other week is bad . Wants to know if CEA decreased ; he’s using the trend as a way to justify putting himself through further treatment .

Saw psych ; prescribed Mirtazapine . Didn’t address whether it was to replace ambien . Pharmacy only had 6 - 7d supply . Once that ran out , he resumed ambien . Thinks mirtazapine worked as well as ambien . Has remainder of month - supply at Bartell’s , but hasn’t picked it up yet . Continues to be anxious—admits that it is debilitating at times . Seeing his therapist every 2 weeks .

Starting after infusion on D1 , spends most of his time on the couch x 48 hours . Worsens D4 - 5 . Feels fatigued , malaise , hot s fever , and has a throbbing HA . Still capable of completing iADLs during that time , but it takes a lot out of him . By D7 , he’s back to running errands .

Nausea starting during infusion ; associated c abdominal cramping and sweats . Improved c Atropine PRN x 1 . More severe the first 3 days ; lasted until D6 . Constant . Didn’t use Zofran . Took Ativan 1 tab q 4-6 hours and Compazine once q AM . Each makes him less nauseated . Ativan works quickly . Takes Compazine as preventative measure in AM . Denies emesis .

Gets nauseated when thinking about coming to SCCA . Really sensitive to smells . Turned off by smell of coffee so doesn’t drink it D1 - 6 when usually he drinks 3-4 shots of espresso 2 - 3x daily when he’s not nauseated or feeling malaise .

Appetite started coming back D6 / 7 .

Got more acne this last cycle than he had in the past—was more of a red bumpy rash in the past . Affecting scalp , face , chest , and upper back . Denies pain or itchiness , although is itchy where facial hair is growing in . Skin has gotten really dry in the past . Scalp is sore , but hasn’t started topical oil yet . Takes Doxycycline 100 mg BID and Clindamycin lotion most nights . Doesn’t use Clindamycin lotion more often because its strong smell makes him nauseated . Hasn’t tried gentle cleansers or moisturizers .

Developed shooting , burning L leg pain rated 7-8/10 on 05 / 04 . Intermittent . Aggravated by leg movement ; less severe when tip - toeing . Starts in calf and radiates up to thigh . Treated c hydrocodone 2 tabs BID which would provide relief for most of the day . Slowly improving . Denies calf pain , LE edema , rash , or skin changes . Hasn’t resumed Mg . feels similar to episode he had 2-3 months ago—went to UWMC . Work up was negative ; in the end , it was attributed to electrolyte imbalance .

Went s BM x2 - 3d after infusion . D5 or D6 , he had 4-5 formed , small BMs . Afterward , resumed normal caliber soft , formed BMs 1 - 2x daily . Untreated . Denies diarrhea , hematochezia , melena .

Developed 1 small sore on tip of his tongue . Gums were sore a couple days ago ; untreated . Didn’t affect PO intake . Definitely better s 5 FU push . Denies xerostomia , taste changes , pharyngitis , odynophagia .
