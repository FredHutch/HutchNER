ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Ms. Williams is a 59 year old female with stage IIa , T2N0M0 invasive ductal breast carcinoma , ER / PR neg , Her2Nu positive in 20 % of cells , status post lumpectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy including herceptin that had to be discontinued early secondary to cardiotoxicity , presenting for routine 6 month follow - up . Ms. Williams is doing well without complaints or symptoms of metastatic disease or post - chemotherapy toxicity .

She does continue to have stable scar tissue in the left breast below the nipple which is consistent with fibrosis . Her mammogram today was negative .

She asked whether cholesterol and Vit D could be added to her labs from today and I will try to get these added and call her with the results .

She will return to see me in one year with labs ( CBC chem20 chol Vit D ) and bilateral screening mammogram at that time . After that visit she can either transition to Wellness or continue follow-up with her PCP , as she will be > 5 yrs out from her diagnosis .
