ATTENDING ONCOLOGIST
Ed Lin , MD

IDENTIFICATION
Michael McDonald is a 66 - year - old male with a long history of Crohn 's disease , now with recurrent metastatic KRAS - wild type colon cancer originally diagnosed in December 2008 . He has thoracic and abdominal wall metastases and presents today to initiate third - line therapy with irinotecan and cetuximab . He is seen in clinic prior to infusion for assessment and lab review .

CURRENT TREATMENT
Irinotecan and cetuximab every 2 weeks .

Today is cycle 1 day 1 .

TREATMENT HISTORY
1 .
Colon cancer originally diagnosed in December 2008 ; T4 N0 well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with predominant mucin production ; status post en bloc right hemicolectomy with excision of the abdominal wall and abdominal reconstruction with mesh ; tumor located at the colostomy site with focal extension to deep tissue ; 0 / 22 lymph nodes were involved and note that the tumor invaded all levels of the bowel with extension into the surrounding skin .
2 .
FOLFOX / Avastin initiated in March 2009 . Oxaliplatin was discontinued secondary to an infusion reaction .
3 .
Single - agent 5 - FU administered through September 2009 .
4 .
May 2009 PET scan revealed possible hypermetabolic lesion , however , the patient was lost to followup with his oncologist .
5 .
Right large chest wall lesion : 14.5 cm at longest dimension with a fungating mass involving the subcutaneous tissue and muscle extending from rib # 7 to his umbilicus in September 2012 .
6 .
Status post surgical resection with an abdominal wall / chest wall mass excision and reconstruction on November 21 , 2012 with a 14 - cm , invasive , moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma involving the skin dermis , perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion with close but negative margins and 1 / 2 positive lymph nodes noted . The intramammary lymph node was not removed at surgery .
7 .
Followed by surveillance with increasing CEA and a January 22 , 2013 PET-CT scan revealed increase in size and uptake of the right inframammary lymph node now up to 1.7 cm in size and new multifocal areas of increased uptake in the lungs and left hilar region likely representing pneumonia .
8 .
He initiated CAPIRI chemotherapy on February 5 , 2013 . However , due to Avastin - related side effects including poor wound healing initially and headaches , he received only 2 doses of Avastin .
9 .
May - July , 2013 : Chemoradiation therapy at Valley Medical with Dr. Douglas to treat intramammary lymph node .
10 .
October 16 , 2013 - May 2014 : CAPIRI plus Avastin with dose reescalation due to progression noted on PET / CT performed September 18 , 2013 .
11 .
June 3 , 2014 : PET / CT demonstrates mild progression in hilar nodes and abdominal wall masses .
12 .
June 17 , 2014 : Initiation of irinotecan and cetuximab .

IMAGING
PET / CT
6/3/2014

Impression :
Findings are consistent with interval disease progression :

1 . Mild interval increase in the degree of FDG avidity within a known right and left hilar lymph nodes , internal mammary lymph nodes .

2 . Mild interval increase in the degree of FDG avidity involving multiple abdominal wall metastases .

3 . Mildly increased FDG uptake in the left 2 nd posterior rib , corresponding to minimal cortical sclerosis is indeterminate , and could represent post traumatic changes . Bone metastasis , although less likely , can not be entirely excluded .

ASSESSMENT / PLAN
1 .
Treatment . ECOG performance status is 1 and labs are stable . Proceed with chemotherapy as scheduled , outlined above .
2 .
Chemo toxicities . Discussed possible side effects with chemo , most noteably skin rash . He has an historical allergy to tetracycline , reported as unknown reaction when he had it as a child in the '50s . Will discuss with Roy Mock , GI pharmacist , re : alternatives to minocycline as rash prophylaxis . Rx provided for hydrocortisone 1 % cream prn pruritic rash . . Avoid sun , wear sunscreen , use emolients . He will have a full chemo teach session later today .
3 .
RUQ abdominal pain , chronic and stable . Recommend use of Tylenol prn ( max 2000 mg/day ) , Celebrex if tolerated .
4 .
FEN . Sodium is low today , although at his baseline . Likely due , in part , to Celexa . Encouraged increased PO fluids with focus on electrolyte drinks . Weight grossly stable and reports eating well .

Dispo - RTC on July 2 nd and I will see him at that time prior to his next infusion .
