IDENTIFICATION
Rica Hablero is a pleasant 24 - year - old female diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the colon in February 2009 , now with peritoneal carcinomatosis . She is K - ras wild type and is currently receiving cetuximab , bevacizumab and irinotecan every two weeks . She was seen in clinic prior to infusion to be assessed for toxicities and check her labs .

CURRENT TREATMENT
1 .
Cetuximab 500 mg / m2 , day one every two weeks .
2 .
Irinotecan 100 mg / m2 , day one every two weeks .
3 .
Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV day one every two weeks .

TREATMENT HISTORY
1 .
02/24/2009 - Right hemicolectomy for obstructing tumor . Preoperative CEA 34.2 . Postoperative pathology extremely high - risk . Postoperative restaging showed elevated and rising CEA and multiple PET - positive retroperitoneal lymph nodes .
2 .
03/16/2009 - 06/9/2009 : FOLFIRI plus or minus Avastin ( Avastin held in the perisurgical period )
3 .
07/18/2009 : Exploratory laparotomy , resection of ileocolonic anastomosis , retroperitoneal lymph node dissection . Pathology revealed 3 / 16 lymph nodes positive with metastatic adenocarcinoma .
4 .
09/01/2009 - 2/22/2010 : Systemic chemotherapy with FOLFIRI and Avastin .
5 .
3/15/2010 - 9/20/2010 : Systemic chemotherapy with capecitabine and bevacizumab , complicated by progression of disease in the peritoneum .
6 .
11/12/2010 : Exploratory laparotomy with resection of subhepatic space metastatic nodules . Surgery performed by Mika Sinanan , MD , Attending Physician , at the University of Washington Medical Center . Intraoperative findings included scar tissue in the mesentery , but no palpable nodularity in the mesentery , omentum , or on the surface of the liver . The two metastatic nodules in the subhepatic space were adherent to the retroperitoneum and liver and were buried in fat . There were not attached to the duodenum . Both nodules were removed completely . Surgical pathology showed one nodule with fibroadipose tissue , reactive fibroplasia , and no carcinoma . Three nodules included a superior subhepatic nodule and inferior subhepatic nodule and subhepatic tissue ; also , metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma extending focally to the surgical margins . Areas of organized lymphoid tissue suggested that the lesions may represent nodal metastases .
7 .
12/17/2010 - 2/1/2011 : Systemic chemotherapy with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab . Treatment

discontinued due to small volume peritoneal progression and decision to switch chemotherapy to IP
8 .
3/9/2011 : Laparoscopic placement of an intraperitoneal port by Dr. Heidi Gray , SCCA . Intraoperative findings

of minimal adhesions and no bulky peritoneal disease .
9 .
3/15/2011 - 4/5/2011 : Intraperitoneal chemotherapy and intravenous Avastin for 2 three - week cycles . IP

chemo was complicated by intractable nausea and vomiting on day 1 and inability to administer treatment on day 2

and 3 of both cycles .
10 .
4/20/2011 - Present : Systemic chemotherapy with CBI
11 .
8/1/2011 : Removal of IP port .

INTERVAL HISTORY
Rica is seen in clinic prior to her next dose of chemo . She had her IP port removed on Monday and has some lingering soreness at the site , but is not taking any pain medication at this time . She states that she had a reaction to one of the premedications prior to her last cycle of chemo which manifested as tensing of muscles and confusion for about 10 seconds . She is not sure which medication caused this reaction , and it resolved spontaneously without adverse effects . Chemo toxicities are limited to nausea on days 1 and 2 and lose stools on days 1-7 that she treats with Lomotil . Otherwise she is doing ok . Her energy level is baseline and she is eating well . She denies weight loss , fevers , chills , bleeding , or other sites of pain . Her peri-anal discomfort has improved .

ECOG performance status is 1 .

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
In summary , Rica Hablero is a lovely 24 - year - old female with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma . She is KRAS wild type . She is tolerating treatment with grade 1 diarrhea and nausea , both of which are manageable at this time .

1 .
Chemotherapy . Based on her ECOG of 1 and her labs , she can receive chemotherapy today . She will monitor for additional premed reactions and be in touch with us as needed .
2 .
Diarrhea . Continue Lomotil and Imodium regularly . Will monitor .
3 .
Nausea . Continue lorazepam as needed . This seems to work the best for her .
4 .
Continue regular exercise , healthy diet . Supplements and supportive medications as needed .

Followup . Rica is scheduled to return to clinic on August 17 , 2011 for a pre-chemo visit with Dr. Whiting , and again on August 31 st for a pre-chemo visit with myself .
