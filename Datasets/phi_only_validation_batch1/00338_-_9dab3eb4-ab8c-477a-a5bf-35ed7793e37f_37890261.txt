ASSESSMENT & PLAN
Ms. Ball is a 24 yo F with AML , history of neutropenic fever and seizures admitted for second cycle of CLAG consolidation chemotherapy .

# . Acute myelogenous leukemia : Consolidation chemotherapy Day 5 ( D1 = 10 / 8 ) with CLAG s/p filgrastim priming . Pt is FLT3 + and has translocation of 6 ; 11 and deletion of 9 . Pt not neutropenic , ANC 1400 this AM . TLS and DIC labs remain unremarkable . Now s/p LP that was unremarkable by flow for malignancy . She was given IT cytarabine with LP .
- CLAG : Filgrastim subcutaneously days 0-5 , cladribine days 1-5 , and cytarabine IV days 1-5 ( 25 % reduction ) .
- Prophylaxis : Allopurinol 300 mg qD , acyclovir 800 mg BID , Posaconazole 200 mg TID , Levaquin 750 mg qHS - > switched to ceftaz 10 / 10 .
- Antiemetics per powerplan + scopolamine patch
- TLS labs qD , can d/c once chemo done .
- IVF per powerplan
- Transfusion thresholds plt 10 , hct 26
- PRBCs : 10 / 11

# . SIRS physiology : Resolved since ystd afternoon . Pt afebrile as well , however has been taking tylenol fairly regularly for her headache . Previously thought pt could be reacting to chemo , however she didn 't have a rxn last night . She hasn 't had SIRs physiology or fever since yesterday around 0600 . This somewhat coincides with initiation fo ceftaz the night before , suggesting an infectious etiology to pt 's sx , however pt is still without a clear source . Also possible is sinusitis or infectious meningitis , although the later is very unlikely and pt 's CSF was negative for infection .
- d/c ceftaz for now as pt stable , adding levaquin 750 mg qHS
- Tylenol PRN HA and fever

# . Headache : Ddx includes migraine , tension HA , side efx from medications ( GCSF , cytarabine ) and / or side efx from LP . Neuro saw pt and helped evaluate ystd as well , they agree HA history is difficult to tease out , but does include rxn to chemo and migraine . Decided to wait on med changes for now , monitor pt as today is the last day of chemo . Could consider switching her to toprimate from keppra for HA and seizure prevention in the future if requires . Pt reports HA is better today .
- gabapentin
- d/c caffeine 100 mg q6hr
- oxycodone
- tylenol

# . Seizures : Hasn 't had any since admission . Pt 's Keppra increased to 1500 from 1000 , which likely helping . EEG normal , however this doesn 't completely rule out the diagnosis of epilepsy . Neurology saw pt and given her mother 's description of events , it 's likely pt has been experiencing seizures . As far as why they presented themselves with chemotherapy tx and not for the last several years is unknown .
- Neurology following , appreciate recs
- Keppra 1500 mg q12hr ( if nauseated convert keppra to IV ; same dose )
- Ativan if seizure > 2 min

STABLE / RESOLVED ISSUES :
# Low back pain and weakness : Improved . pt has long hx and sounds like worsens with intense mood and deconditioning . Has some elements of neuropathic involvement with shooting sensation down bil legs to mid thigh area . She has hx of " slipped discs " , reports not having any prior back / spine imaging . Pt is morbidly obese as well as markedly deconditioned for a woman of her age . Her weakness can be further worsening her LBP . As far as etiology of weakness , seems to have started around when AML was diagnosed , now using a walker or wheelchair and with slow gait , doesn 't appear to have ataxic gait . Again concern for chemo toxicity , but also could be severe deconditioning from severe illness induced myopathy when pt in ICU in September 2014 .
- gabapentin 300 mg qHS
- PT/OT

# . Memory deficits : Unclear etiology at this time . Ddx includes iatrogenic / toxic from medications , possible post-ictal state as well as PTSD . Most likely this is a chemotherapy side effect , and hope memory clears with time . Further evaluation of seizures as above , but keppra can also cause a sedation - like state , although mild , which could contribute . Pt does not have hx of PTSD , but this is also known to cause memory deficits .
- CTM

# . Diarrhea : Resolved . likely chemo related or IBS as pt having difficulties with anxiety and mood lately . C diff negative 10 / 09 .
- Loperamide prn

# . Adjustment disorder with anxiety : pt followed by psychologist as outpt . Diagnosed after AML .
- Sertraline
