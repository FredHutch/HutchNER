Scan shows : Impression :
Right upper extremity PICC line in expected and unaltered position .
Otherwise normal exam .
.


Assessment / Plan
PRIMARY DISEASE :
- - AML in relapse . Day 16 of MEC / anti - CXCR4 chemo . Donor lymphocytes from her HLA identical father infused on 12 / 15 and 12/12/2011 .

HEMATOLOGY :
- - Thresholds : Hct 30 % , Plts 10k .
- - Neutropenia . From chemo , awaiting recovery .

INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
- - Afebrile . Prophylaxis with levofloxacin , acyclovir , dapsone . Linezolid PO for prior neutropenic fevers now resolved , dc 12/15/11 .
- - Aspergillus pneumonia . Continue voriconazole with last CT done 12 / 1 which showed improvement . Pt was previously also on micafungin .
- - IgG level 12/02/11 pending .

GRAFT VS HOST DISEASE :
- - None . Off immunosupression .

REGIMEN RELATED TOXICITY :
- - Diarrhea resolved , likely associated with linezolid , chemo toxicity . Stool for C . difficile and enteric screen negative on 12 / 13 .

PULMONARY :
- - Aspergillus pneumonia . Resolving with voriconazole . CXR normal as above .

CARDIOVASCULAR :
- - CHF . MUGA with global hypokinesis and LVEF 35-36 % on 11 / 30 .
- - Intermittent hypotension , it was noticed that she was taking half of her dose of hydrocortisone . She resume corrent dose on last friday and also her previous anti-hypertensive medication .
- - Cardiogenic Edema with bronchospasm after DLI infusion : related to that vs fluid overload . On albuterol .

GASTROINTESTINAL :
- - Diarrhea . See RRT above .
- - GERD . Continue omeprazole .

ENDOCRINE :
- - Adrenal insufficiency . Continue hydrocortisone 20 mg alternating 30 mg daily .
- - She had a radom cortisol of 28.7 last week , once she was on wrong dose she will repeat on next labs .

FLUIDS , ELECTROLYTES , NUTRITION :
- - HypoMg2 + , will start oral repletion ( and minibag tomorrow ) .


Comments
Jaishri is doing ok , no signs of GVHD so far and she stills pancytopenic . She will receive BRC transfusion tomorrow .
She has new respiratory symptoms ( bronchospasm at night , after laying down ) that started after the 1 st DLI infusion . It resembles a cardiogenic edema , likely related to her severe HF , but also could be directly related to the DLI infusion correlcting that with the time of presentation . She will continue with albuterol and her antypertensive medication and we will follow this over the next days .
