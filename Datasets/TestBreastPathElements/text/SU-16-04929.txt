( CXH / pwt ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Blais , Heidi , B. left axillary sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 1.9 x 1.6 x 0.9 cm portion of fibroadipose and lymphoid tissue .   
There is a 1.4 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm lymph node candidate identified that is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in B1 .   
( CXH / pwt ) C )     Received in formalin labeled " Blais , Heidi , C. left axillary sentinel lymph node # 3 " is a 2.7 x 2 x 1.3 cm lymph node candidate is serially sectioned and submitted entirely in C1 .   
( CXH / pwt ) D ) Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Blais , Heidi Marie " and " left breast lumpectomy . " 
Specimen type :   Lumpectomy Formalin time :   02/26/2016 8 p.m. , 20 hours . 
Tissue obtained for tumor banking : No Weight :   35 g Size :   2.5 SI x 4.0 ML x 5.0 AP cm , skin 4.0 x 0.5 cm Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 8 sections of 0.4 cm average thickness 
, slice 1 is 0.7 cm and slice 8 is 1.0 cm . 
Findings Lesion # 1 :   Tan - white , firm , spiculated mass . 
Size : 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.9 cm ; the third dimension , 1 cm , is based on the cumulative thickness of involved slices 4 and 5 .

Distance to margins : 0.2 cm from the inferior margin , 1.0 cm from the posterior margin , 0.9 cm from the superior margin , 0.6 cm from the anterior margin and widely free of the medial and lateral margins . 
Submitted : Representatively .
