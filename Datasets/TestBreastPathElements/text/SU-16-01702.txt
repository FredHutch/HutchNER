. SUMMARY CANCER DATA : Specimen and procedure Procedure :     Excision with wire - guided localization Specimen laterality :     Right Invasive carcinoma with the following features : Histologic type :     Invasive ductal carcinoma , NOS ( 85003 ) Size ( largest focus ) :     0.9 cm Comment about size determination : A 0.9 cm focus of carcinoma is surrounding one biopsy site .   
Another biopsy site is identified but no carcinoma is identified around this biopsy site . 
Focality of invasive carcinoma :     Single contiguous focus Nottingham Grade :     Grade III : 8 - 9 points - Tubule Formation :     3 points ( < 10% ) - Nuclear Pleomorphism :     3 points ( severe ) - Mitotic Activity :     2 points Ancillary Studies Source :     Outside pathology laboratory ( by report only ) Comment :     SU-16 - 00216 Estrogen receptor :     Positive Allred score :     8 of 8 Progesterone receptor :     Positive Allred score :     8 of 8 c - erb - B2 ( her 2 ) by IHC :     Not performed / reported Ki-67 proliferative index :     30% HER 2 by FISH :     
Positive for HER 2 gene amplification by FISH Angiolymphatic Space Invasion :     Not identified Skin status :     Can not assess ( skin not present ) Nipple status :     Can not assess ( nipple not present ) Skeletal muscle status :     Skeletal muscle not present Ductal carcinoma in - situ ( DCIS ) :     Not identified Lobular carcinoma in - situ ( LCIS ) :     Absent Changes consistent with previous biopsy site :     Present Comment about previous biopsy site : Two biopsy sites are identified .   
Carcinoma surrounds only one biopsy site .   
It appears the remainder of the carcinoma was biopsied away at the other biopsy site . 
Final surgical resection margins ( including separately submitted margins ) : Invasive carcinoma margins :     Invasive carcinoma > = 0.5 cm from all margins DCIS margin :     Not applicable ( no DCIS present ) Lymph node involvement Sentinel nodes :     Sentinel nodes with carcinoma 0     / Total sentinel nodes 1 Non - sentinel nodes :     Non - sentinel nodes with carcinoma : 0     / Total non - sentinel nodes : 0 - Total number of nodes with macrometastases :     0 - Total number of nodes with micrometastases :     0 - Total number of nodes with isolated tumor cells :     0 Minimum pathologic stage ( AJCC , 7th ed . , 2010 ) TNM descriptors :     none Primary tumor [ pT ] :     pT1b : Tumor > 0.5 cm and < = 1.0 cm - greatest dimension Regional nodes [ pN ] :     pN0 : No regional lymph node metastasis histologically ( ITCs may be present ) N stage modifier :     ( sn ) : Only sentinel node(s ) evaluated . _

GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Lai , Jennie , right axilla sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 2.2 x 1.5 x 0.6 cm blue - stained lymph node .   
The specimen is bisected and entirely submitted in two cassettes .   
( SR / pwt ) B )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Lai , Jennie " and " B , right breast lumpectomy . " Specimen type :   Wire - localized lumpectomy Formalin time :   7:35 p.m. on January 21 , 2016 Tissue obtained for tumor banking :   No Weight :   75 g Size :    3.0 SI x 7.5 ML x 6.0 AP cm Oriented With :   Skin , inked , and wires . Ink :   Per protocol " by the surgeon " if received inked :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . 
Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 9 sections of 0.5 cm average thickness . 
Findings :    Two lesions as follows : Lesion # 1 :   Fibrous , somewhat stellate lesion involving slices 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 Size : 2 x 2 x 1 cm Biopsy site :   Identified in slice # 7 Distance to margins : 1.2 cm to lateral margin , 1.0 to anterior margin , 2.5 to posterior margin , 2.5 to inferior margin , 0.7 cm to superior margin . 
Relationship to other structures :   0.6 cm from lesion # 2 Submitted : Entirely . 
Lesion # 2 :   White , fibrous and somewhat granular lesion involving slices 6 - 8 . 
Size : 1.0 x 0.8 x 1.5 cm Biopsy site :   Cavity present involving slices 6 , 7 , and 8 Distance to margins : Lesion grossly abuts the anterior / inferior margin and is 2.5 cm from superior margin , 3.0 cm from posterior margin , 0.5 cm from the medial margin , and 2.0 cm from the lateral margin Submitted : Entirely . 
Cassettes submitted :   Representative sections are submitted as follows : B1 , B2 - perpendicular sections through lateral margin , slice 1 , entirely submitted B3 - anterior margin , slice 2 B4 - anterior slice 3 B5 , B6 - anterior slice 4 B7 , B8 - anterior slice 5 B9-B12 - composite of slice 6 B13-B17 - composite of slice 7 B18-B21 - anterior portion of slice 8 B22 , B23 - perpendicular sections through slice # 9 , entirely submitted The specimen is reviewed with Melissa Ardales , P.A. ( PDS / kc ) C )     Received in a container of formalin labeled " Lai , Jennie , true superior medial margin right breast " is an 8 g , 4.8 x 3.2 x 1 cm tan - yellow portion of fibrofatty breast tissue .   
The true margins of resection have been inked by the surgeon as follows :   one yellow and one red .   
The specimen is serially cross sectioned and no intramural masses are identified .   
The tissue is entirely submitted sequentially in nine cassettes .
