GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Lewis , Savannah , A. right axillary sentinel lymph node # 1 " is a 2.9 x 1.9 x 1.2 cm aggregate of adipose tissue and lymphoid .   
There are lymph node candidates identified , 1.0 x 0.4 x 0.4 cm to 2.9 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm .   
The lymph node candidates are entirely submitted as follows : A1 - one lymph node candidate , bisected A2-A4 - one lymph node candidate , serially sectioned ( CXH / ch ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Lewis , Savannah , B. right axillary sentinel lymph node # 2 " is a 3.3 x 2.5 x 1.8 cm aggregate of fibroadipose tissue and lymphoid .   
There are seven lymph node candidates identified , 0.2 - 2.7 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm .   
The largest lymph node candidate is blue locating dyed .   
The lymph node candidates are entirely submitted as follows : B1 - three lymph node candidates B2 - three lymph node candidates , differentially - inked and each bisected B3-B5 - largest lymph node candidate , serially sectioned ( CXH / ch ) C )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Lewis , Savannah , C. right partial mastectomy . " 
Specimen type :   Partial mastectomy . 
Formalin time :   02/12/2016 at 7:30 a.m. , with a total fixation time of 10 hours , 10 minutes . 
Tissue obtained for tumor banking :   No Weight :   29 
g Size :   4.5 cm SI x 5.7 cm ML x 2.7 cm AP Oriented With :   Inking Ink :   Per protocol by the surgeon :   superior = red , inferior = blue , anterior = green , posterior = black , medial = yellow , lateral = orange . 
Sectioning :   Medial to lateral in 11 slices , numbered respectively ( slice 1 = 0.8 and slice 11 = 1.0 cm thick ) , 0.4 cm average thickness central slices . 
Findings :   Lesion # 1 : 
Size :   2.1 x 2.0 x 1.7 cm .   
The mass is within slices 4 - 8 .
