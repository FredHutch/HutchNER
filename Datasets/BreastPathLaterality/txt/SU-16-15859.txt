IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Carcinoma cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     10 % positive cells     Positive ( Allred 4 of 8) Intensity : Intermediate ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Ilvanakis , Susan , R. 10:00 NME " are seven fibrofatty tissue cores ranging from 1.7 to 2.6 cm in length and up to 0.4 cm in diameter .   
The specimens are wrapped , inked blue and submitted entirely in A1-A2 .   
( HQ / kc ) The specimen was collected on 06/20/16 at 3:56 p.m. resulting in an approximate 16 hours 30 minutes fixation in formalin .
