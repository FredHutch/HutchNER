GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh labeled " Ilvanakis , Susan , A. right breast lumpectomy " is a 12.0 g oriented portion of fibrofatty tissue with a short stitch designating superior , a long stitch designating lateral and needle localization wire entering laterally and exiting medial superior .   
It is 3.2 cm medial to lateral x 2.2 cm superior to inferior x 1.8 cm anterior to posterior .   
It is received previously inked : superior - red , inferior - blue , lateral - orange , medial - yellow , anterior - green , posterior - black .   
It is sectioned into six slices numbered respectively from medial to lateral . 
Slices 3 and 4 is an ill - defined 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.6 cm tan stellate mass , rod - shaped clip in slice 4 .   
Mass is 0.6 cm from the superior margin , 1.2 cm from the inferior margin , 0.8 cm from the anterior margin , 0.6 cm from the posterior margin , greater than 1.0 cm from the medial and lateral margins .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow lobulated adipose tissue ( 25% ) intermixed with extremely dense and nodular fibrous tissue ( 75% ) .   
The tissue is entirely submitted : A1 - composite slice 1 ( perpendicular ) A2-A3 - composite slice 2 A4-A5 - composite slice 3 A6-A7 - composite slice 4 A8-A9 - composite slice 5 A10 - composite slice 6 ( perpendicular ) B )     Received in formalin labeled " Ilvanakis , Susan , B. right breast superior margin " is a 1.8 g , 3.2 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm breast reexcision specimen previously inked red on one surface presumably designating the new superior margin .

No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 60% ) intermixed with dense white fibrous tissue ( 40% ) .   
The tissue is entirely submitted : B1 - slices 1 and 9 B2 - slices 2 , 3 , and 4 B3 - slices 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 C )     Received in formalin labeled " Ilvanakis , Susan , C. right breast medial margin " is a 10.2 g , 3.0 x 2.3 x 1.0 cm breast reexcision specimen previously inked yellow , presumably designating the new medial margin .   
The opposite surface is uninked .   
It is sectioned from one end to the opposite into eight slices numbered respectively .   
Slices 4 - 6 is a 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm red - brown hemorrhagic area that is 0.1 cm from the new medial margin .   
No other discrete mass or lesion is identified .   
The remaining cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue ( 30% ) intermixed with dense white mildly nodular fibrous tissue ( 70% ) .
