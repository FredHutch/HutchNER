Other _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ FINAL DIAGNOSIS : A )   Right breast , 9:30 o'clock , excisional biopsy : - Breast parenchyma with cyst cavity lined by foreign body - type giant cell reaction , consistent with previous procedure site 
. - Stromal fibrosis , focal mild ductal hyperplasia , and mild dilatation of ducts . 
- Microcalcifications associated with benign breast parenchyma . 
- Negative for in - situ or invasive carcinoma . 
B )   Right breast , 11:30 o'clock , excisional biopsy : - Breast parenchyma with cyst cavity lined by foreign body - type giant cell reaction , consistent with previous procedure site . 
- Stromal fibrosis and multiple foci of sclerosing adenosis . 
- Microcalcifications associated with benign breast parenchyma . 
- Negative for in - situ or invasive carcinoma . 
C )   Right breast , 10 o'clock , lumpectomy : - Ductal carcinoma in - situ , high nuclear grade with comedo necrosis . 
- The in - situ ductal carcinoma is present adjacent to biopsy site in an approximate area of 2 x 1.5 cm . 
- Biopsy site identified with organizing blood , granulation tissue , hemosiderin deposition and fibrosis . 
- Fibrocystic changes including apocrine metaplasia , sclerosing adenosis , cystic dilatation of ducts and stromal fibrosis 
. - Microcalcifications are noted in in - situ carcinoma and in benign ducts 
. - Margins : Closest margin ; Ductal carcinoma in - situ is focally present within 0.1 cm of superior margin . - 
No definitive invasive carcinoma seen ( see comment ) . 
D )   
Right breast , superior margin , excision : - Ductal carcinoma in situ , high nuclear grade with comedo necrosis . 
- Microcalcifications associated with benign ducts 
. - Microcalcifications are noted in in - situ carcinoma and in benign ducts 
. - Margins : Ductal carcinoma in - situ focally involves superior ( red ink ) margin . - 
No definite invasive carcinoma is seen ( see comment ) . 
COMMENT : Parts C and D : Immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63 highlights myoepithelial cells around neoplastic foci ( blocks C9 , C11 and D3 ) , supporting the impression of ductal carcinoma in - situ , with no invasive carcinoma . 
Selected slides were reviewed by Dr. Mark Kilgore , who concurs with the above impression .
