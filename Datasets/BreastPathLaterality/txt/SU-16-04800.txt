SUMMARY CANCER DATA : Specimen and procedure Procedure :     Total mastectomy ( including nipple and skin ) Specimen laterality :     Left Primary tumor ( status post pre - surgical therapy ) No evidence of residual invasive carcinoma Estimated treatment response in breast :     Complete pathologic response ( no residual invasive carcinoma ) Pre - treatment tumor characteristics Pre - treatment Nottingham grade :     Score can not be determined Reason Nottingham score can not be determined : Microinvasive carcinoma in association with DCIS was identified .   
The carcinoma was not graded . 
Pre - treatment ER :     Negative ( Allred < = 2 ) Pre - treatment PR :     Negative Pre - treatment her 2 by IHC :     Positive for her 2 overexpression by immunohistochemistry Pre - treatment characteristics comment : ( The outside biopsy was reviewed at UWMC .   
Please see report SU-15 - 22790 ) . 
Additional findings DCIS ( ductal carcinoma in situ ) :     Residual DCIS present ( 85002 ) Nuclear grade of DCIS :     High Necrosis in DCIS :     Not identified Distance spanned by DCIS :     1.5 cm Comment about DCIS : Rare foci of DCIS were identified in a span of 1.5 cm .   
The span of DCIS is based on cumulative thickness of involved slices . 
Microcalcifications :     
Present in non - neoplastic tissue Final surgical resection margins ( including separately submitted margins ) : Invasive carcinoma margins :     Not applicable ( no invasive carcinoma present ) DCIS margin :     DCIS > = 0.5 cm from all inked margins Lymph node involvement ( S / P neoadjuvant therapy ) No lymph nodes to examine post - therapy Minimum pathologic stage ( AJCC , 7th ed . , 2010 ) 
Primary tumor [ pT ] :     ypTis ( DCIS ) : Ductal carcinoma in situ Regional nodes [ pN ] :     ypNX : Can not be assessed _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CLINICAL DATA : GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " A. right breast " Specimen type :   Skin sparing mastectomy Formalin time :   It is placed in formalin at 8:00 p.m. on 02/24/2016 with a total fixation time of approximately 21 hours and 40 minutes Tissue obtained for tumor banking :

Submitted :   Representative sections are submitted as follows : A1 - nipple and areola , bisected A2 - upper outer quadrant , two sections A3 - upper inner quadrant , two sections A4 - lower inner quadrant , two sections A5 - lower outer quadrant , two sections ( CXH / clk ) B )     Received :   Fresh in a container designated " Pegg , Constance , left breast " Specimen type :   Mastectomy Formalin time :   02/24/2016 , 9:00 p.m. , 18 hours . 
Tissue obtained for tumor banking : No Weight :   292 g 
Overall size :   16.0 ( SI ) x 15.0 ( ML ) x 2.5 ( AP ) cm Skin :   None Nipple and Areola :   Unremarkable areola , 4.0 cm in diameter ; unremarkable nipple , 4.0 cm in diameter . 
Ink :   Per protocol , deep = black , superior superficial = orange , inferior superficial = blue Sectioning :   From lateral to medial into sixteen slices with an average thickness of 0.5 cm . 
Findings :   Tan - white , firm , fibrotic scar Location :   2:00 , 5.0 cm from nipple Size :   1.5 x 1.6 x 1.8 cm ; the third dimension ( 1.8 cm ) is based on cumulative thickness of involved slices 4 - 6 . 
Distance to deep margin :   0.7 cm ; to superior superficial margin 2.0 cm ; to inferior superficial margin 3.0 cm . 
Evidence of prior biopsy or procedure :   Scar observed . 
Background breast :   Approximately 80% unremarkable yellow lobulated tissue with intervening white fibrous band . 
Submitted :   Representative sections are submitted as follows : B1 - slice 2 , tissue lateral to mass B2 - slice 3 , tissue lateral to mass B3-B4 - slice 4 , mass composite section B5-B6 - slice 5 , mass composite section B7-B10 - slice 6 , medial extent of mass , composite section B11-B12 - slice 7 , tissue medial to mass B13 - slice 8 , tissue medial to mass B14 - slice 9 , tissue medial to mass B15 - upper outer quadrant B16 - upper inner quadrant B17 - lower inner quadrant B18 - lower outer quadrant B19 - nipple ( RB / ch ) Rajnish   Bharadwaj MBBS , PhD AP Resident 02/27/2016 Sania   Shuja MD , PhD Pathologist Electronically signed

ADDENDUM : This addendum is to add more information about the pre - treatment grading of invasive carcinoma .   
The core needle biopsy of the mass ( reviewed in SU-15 - 22790 ) revealed microinvasive carcinoma that was not graded .   
Subsequently , a lumpectomy was performed , which showed two foci of invasive carcinoma ( see report SU-15 - 25444 ) .   
These were graded as - Nottingham grade III ( poor tubule formation , high nuclear grade , and intermediate mitotic rate ) .
