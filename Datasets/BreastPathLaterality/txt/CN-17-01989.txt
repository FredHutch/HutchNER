See comment . 
COMMENT : 500 mls slightly dark hemorrhagic fluid is received from which one Papanicolaou stained ThinPrep slide and one cell block with hematoxylin and eosin stained slide are made .   
Slides contain atypical cells present singly and in three dimensional clusters with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei , irregular nuclear contours , and occasional prominent nucleoli .   
These findings are positive for malignancy , consistent with involvement by patient 's known breast cancer .   
GATA3 immunostain is positive further supporting this interpretation .   
The prognostic breast marker studies will be reported in an addendum .

ADDENDUM : This addendum is issued to report the results of immunohistochemistry . 
HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization has been ordered and will be reported as another addendum . 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Neopalstic cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     90 % positive cells     Intensity : Intermediate Allred score 7 of 8 . 
A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     20 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong Allred score 6 of 8 . 
ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
The detection system used is the Biotin - free Polymer Detection System . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] . HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

ADDENDUM REASON : 
This addendum is issued to report the results of fluorescence in situ hybridization . 
ADDENDUM COMMENT : HER2 gene amplification is equivocal by fluorescence in situ hybridization due to HER2 copy number . 
Due to this result , HER2 immunohistochemistry was reflexively performed and is also equivocal ( 2 + ) . 
As per the CAP / ASCO guidelines , this result should be considered equivocal for HER2 gene amplification . 
MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION : A recut slide confirms residual invasive carcinoma in the block . 
DNA ANALYSIS : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Neoplastic cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Her2Neu PROBE     4.4 signals / cell     See comment . 
A1     FISH H2N/17     ICC FISH Chromosome 17 PROBE     2.8 signals / cell Ratio : 1.6         Interpretation : EQUIVOCAL for gene amplification ( see comment ) . 
Unstained sections are prepared and regions of invasive carcinoma are marked by comparison with H&E - stained sections from the same block .   
Fluorescence in situ hybridization for the Her-2/neu gene is then carried out using the FDA - approved Vysis Path Vysion HER-2 DNA probe kit .   
The prepared slides are then viewed under a fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters for the chromosome 17 probe ( green ) , the Her-2/neu probe ( orange ) and DNA ( blue ) to localize nuclei .   
Signals are counted from up to 60 cells and the ratio of Her-2/neu to chromosome 17 signals is computed .   
Control slides from non - amplified and low - level amplified tumor cells are prepared simultaneously to ensure reproducibility between assays .   
Results for this morphometric , multiplex assay are listed in the table above .   
This assay has not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results should be interpreted with caution given the likelihood of false negativity on decalcified specimens . 
Note : 
According to the 2013 ASCO / CAP Guideline Recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer ( J Clin Oncol 2013 ; 31 : 3997 - 4013 ) , ratios for HER2/CEP17 of less than 2.0 are interpreted as negative , ratios greater than or equal to 2.0 are interpreted as positive , and ratios less than 2.0 with an average HER2 signals / cell greater than or equal to 4.0 and less than 6.0 are interpreted as equivocal for gene amplification . 
Alternatively , cancers having single - probe average greater than or equal to 6.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted positive and less than 4.0 HER2 signals / cell are interpreted as negative .
