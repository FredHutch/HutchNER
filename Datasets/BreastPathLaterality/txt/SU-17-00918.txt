-   Negative for in situ and invasive carcinoma . 
COMMENT : Each mastectomy specimen shows vaguely circumscribed areas of fibrosis consistent with the remote history of bilateral lumpectomies . 
In addition , the right breast contains minute foci of atypical epithelioid cells in association with elastotic stroma . 
These findings are favored to represent therapy - induced atypia in the context of prior breast radiation . 
Importantly , there is no evidence of in situ or invasive carcinoma . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CLINICAL DATA : Bilateral mastectomies .
