B - E )   Left axillary sentinel lymph nodes # 1 - 4 , excisions : -   4 lymph nodes , negative for carcinoma ( 1 node in each part ) . 
A )   Right breast , total mastectomy : -   Focal atypical ductal hyperplasia ; negative for invasive carcinoma . 
COMMENT : F )   The biopsy site and surrounding tissue was entirely submitted and no residual invasive carcinoma was identified , indicating that the entire span of carcinoma was removed with the needle core biopsy procedure ( SU-16 - 33140 ) . 
Therefore , the Nottingham grade and size of carcinoma outlined in the worksheet below is based on evaluation of the biopsy . 
Dr. Suzanne Dintzis has reviewed representative slides and concurs with the interpretation of focal atypical ductal hyperplasia in the left and right breasts ( parts F and A , respectively ) .
