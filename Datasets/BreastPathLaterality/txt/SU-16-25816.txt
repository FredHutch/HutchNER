FINAL DIAGNOSIS : I ) Right breast , mastectomy : Invasive ductal carcinoma , see Summary Cancer Data below . 
E ) Right axillary sentinel lymph node # 1 , excision : 1 lymph node positive for metastatic carcinoma ( approximately 0.15 cm in maximum span ) ; See comment . 
F , G ) Right axillary sentinel lymph nodes # 2 and # 3 , excisions : 2 lymph nodes negative for carcinoma . 
A ) Left breast , mastectomy : Ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) with the following features : -   Grade : High nuclear grade and without necrosis . -   Extent :   Scattered discontinuous foci , each no more than 0.1 cm , spanning approximately 2.5 cm 
. -   Margins :   DCIS is focally 0.2 cm from the posterior margin and greater than 0.5 cm from all remaining margins 
. -   Microcalcifications : Present in association with non - neoplastic epithelium . 
-   Additional findings : Fibrocystic changes including usual ductal hyperplasia , columnar cell change , apocrine metaplasia , and microcysts . -   Biopsy site changes are present and associated with an organizing hematoma . 
-   Negative for invasive carcinoma . 
C , D ) Left axillary sentinel nodes # 1 and # 2 , excisions : 3 lymph nodes negative for carcinoma . 
B , J ) Left and right nipple margins , excisions : Breast parenchyma , negative for in situ and invasive carcinoma . 
H , K ) Left and right breast tissue , excisions : Skin , negative for neoplasm . 
COMMENT : E ) 
The sentinel lymph node touch preparations were reviewed in conjunction with the histologic sections and the interpretation rendered at the time of intraoperative consultation ( negative for carcinoma ) is unchanged .   
Given the small metastatic focus , the discrepancy between the intraoperative and post - operative diagnoses is attributed to sampling .
