. -   Extent :   0.3 cm in maximum dimension 
. -   Margins :   0.4 cm from the blue - inked margin and greater than 0.5 cm from the black - inked margin 
. -   Microcalcifications :   
Present in association with DCIS and non - neoplastic epithelium . 
-   Negative for invasive carcinoma . 
-   Estrogen receptor status :   Positive ; Allred Score 8 of 8 . 
-   See comment . 
COMMENT : Dr. Suzanne Dintzis and Dr. Mark Kilgore have reviewed representative slides and concur with the diagnosis of DCIS .

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A4 Population : In situ carcinoma Interpreted by :   Emily Huisuk Glynn , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A4     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     90% positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred Score 8 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .
