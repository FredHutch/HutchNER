See Cancer Summary Data Sheet below . 
E - F )   Right axillary sentinel lymph nodes # 1 and # 2 , excisions : No carcinoma identified on H&E and pancytokeratin IHC - stained slides . 
C - D , I )   Left breast , nipple margin , and skin , mastectomy and excisions : -   Breast parenchyma with no in - situ or invasive carcinoma identified . 
-   Nipple , negative for neoplasm . 
A - B )   Left axillary sentinel lymph nodes # 1 and # 2 , excisions :   No carcinoma identified on H&E - stained slides . 
SUMMARY CANCER DATA : Specimen and procedure Procedure :     Nipple and skin sparing mastectomy Specimen laterality :     Right Invasive carcinoma with the following features : Histologic type :     Invasive lobular carcinoma , NOS ( 85203 ) Size ( largest focus ) :     0.1 cm Comment about size determination : Carcinoma is < 0.1 cm .   
Previous biopsy ( SU-16 - 16752 ) also had 2 foci in near proximity to one another , each < 0.1 cm .   
Given the orientation of these foci is not determinable , the neoplasm will be staged based on the single largest contiguous focus ( 0.1 cm ) rather than adding separate foci together .   
This will results in a T stage of microinvasive carcinoma ( pT1mic ) . 
Focality of invasive carcinoma :     Single contiguous focus Comment about extent / focality : Determining focality is a little challenging given there were separate foci present in the biopsy specimen , however , it is favored that the biopsy is representative of sampling of this single contiguous focus . 
Location of carcinoma :     Invasive lobular carcinoma is present in a slice adjacent to the biopsy site with clip . 
Nottingham Grade :     Grade I : 3 - 5 points - Tubule Formation :     3 points ( < 10% ) - Nuclear Pleomorphism :     1 point ( mild ) - Mitotic Activity :     1 point Ancillary Studies Source :     This case ( included in this report ) Estrogen receptor :     See comment Progesterone receptor :     See comment c - erb - B2 ( her 2 ) by IHC :     See comment HER 2 by FISH :     See Comment Ancillary studies comment : This case is particularly challenging in that in both biopsy and mastectomy specimens , the carcinoma is so small and subtle , that after the appropriate studies have been performed to diagnosis carcinoma , there is not enough neoplasm remaining to perform prognostic markers . 
Angiolymphatic Space Invasion :     Not identified Skin status :     Can not assess ( skin not present ) Nipple status :     Can not assess ( nipple not present ) Skeletal muscle status :     Skeletal muscle not present Ductal carcinoma in - situ ( DCIS ) :     Not identified Lobular carcinoma in - situ ( LCIS ) :     Present ( 85202 ) Comment about LCIS : LCIS is extensively present both in association with the focus of invasive carcinoma and in random representative breast sections . 
Additional findings :     Atypical lobular hyperplasia ( ALH ) Changes consistent with previous biopsy site :     Present Final surgical resection margins ( including separately submitted margins ) : Invasive carcinoma margins :     Invasive carcinoma > = 0.5 cm from all margins DCIS margin :     Not applicable ( no DCIS present ) Lymph node involvement Sentinel nodes :     Sentinel nodes with carcinoma 0     / Total sentinel nodes 2 Non - sentinel nodes :     Non - sentinel nodes with carcinoma : 0     / Total non - sentinel nodes : 0 - Total number of nodes with macrometastases :     0 - Total number of nodes with micrometastases :     
0 - Total number of nodes with isolated tumor cells :     0 Minimum pathologic stage ( AJCC , 7th ed . , 2010 ) TNM descriptors :     none Primary tumor [ pT ] :     pT1mic : Microinvasion < =   0.1 cm - greatest dimension in largest focus Regional nodes [ pN ] :     pN0 : No regional lymph node metastasis histologically ( ITCs may be present ) N stage modifier :     ( sn ) : Only sentinel node(s ) evaluated .

Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .

IHC INTERPRETATION : The findings are supportive of both in - situ and invasive lobular carcinoma and negative lymph nodes .

ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

ADDENDUM REASON : 
This addendum is issued for clarification of the right nipple margin and skin specimens , which are uninvolved by carcinoma . 
ADDENDUM COMMENT : Specimens H ( right nipple margin ) and J ( right breast skin ) were initially reported together with specimen G ( right mastectomy ) because they collectively represent the right breast as a whole .   
However , this has caused confusion as it makes it appear as though the right nipple margin and skin are involved by carcinoma , which is incorrect .   
This addendum is issued to clarify this wording to be more accurate of the specimens involved .   
Specimen G ( right mastectomy ) has invasive lobular carcinoma as detailed in the synoptic cancers summary data sheet above .   
Specimens H ( right nipple margin ) and J ( right breast skin ) are negative for carcinoma .   
This information was also communicated to Dr. Calhoun by email by Dr. Kilgore on 8/26/16 .   
The remainder or the above report remains unchanged .
