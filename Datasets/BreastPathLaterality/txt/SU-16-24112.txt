GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Dullum , Annie " and per the requisition slip " right breast mass at 12:30 , 4.0 cm FN core biopsy " are four tan - yellow fibrofatty cores of soft tissue averaging 1.5 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter ; wrapped , inked blue , and entirely submitted in cassettes A1-A2 .   
Total formalin fixation time :   7 hours .

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Neoplastic cells Interpreted by :   Kathryn A Christofersen and Rochelle L Garcia , MD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     80 % positive cells     Allred score 8 of 8 A1     Fixation time QA     Fixation time QA on predictive markers     7 Meets requirements A1     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     High over - expression ( 3 + ) A1     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     25 % positive cells A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     95 % positive cells     Allred score 8 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .
