Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IHC INTERPRETATION : Immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin confirm the histologic impression of lack of metastatic carcinoma . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received fresh in a container labeled with the correct patient name " Richardson , Claire " designated as " right breast lumpectomy with wire localization " . 
The specimen has been previously inked by the surgeon as per protocol designated as superior : red inferior : blue lateral : orange medial : yellow anterior : green and posterior : black .   
The lumpectomy specimen weighs 158 g and measures 11 x 10 x 3.5 cm .   
An ellipse of tan - brown unremarkable skin is present anteriorly measuring approximately 9 x 2 cm .   
Three localizing wires are identified running from anterior to posterior .   
The wires are removed .   
The specimen is sectioned in thirteen slices from anterior to posterior .   
The posterior slice measures approximately 0.4 cm and the anterior slice measures approximately 0.6 cm .   
The remaining slices measure approximately 0.4 cm .   
Sectioning reveals tan - yellow to lobular cut surface with multiple areas of tan - white fibrosis . 
The specimen was radiographed to identify the clips . 
Three clips were identified , 2 in slice 7 and 1 clip in slice 10 . 
In slice 7 and ill - defined tan - white firm mass ( lesion # 1 ) is identified measuring approximately 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm , with central rectangular metallic clip .   The mass lies approximately 2 cm from the red - inked superior margin ,   2 cm from the yellow - inked medial margin approximately 5.5 cm from the blue - inked inferior margin , 3.5 cm from the orange - inked lateral margin , and widely free of the posterior and anterior margins .   
( 4.5 cm from the posterior and 0.5 cm from the anterior margins ) .   
Adjacent to lesion # 1 is another metallic clip identified embedded in possibly tan - white fibrous tissue .   
The distance between lesion # 1 and lesion # 2 is approximately 1.2 cm .   
The clip in possible lesion # 2 lies approximately 2 cm from the red - inked margin , 3.5 cm from the yellow , 6.5 cm from the blue ,   5 cm from the orange , 4 cm from posterior and 5.5 cm from anterior .   
Lesion # 2 measures approximately 0.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm . 
Lesion # 3 is identified within slice 10 approximately 1.3 cm from lesion 1 and 2 .   
The clip was identified embedded in fibrous tissue loosely attached to the main specimen , and abuts the red - inked superior margin . 
No discrete masses are identified .   
The area of the lesion # 3 is approximately 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm .   
Lesion # 3 lies approximately 3.5 cm from the orange inked lateral margin , 5.5 cm from the blue inked inferior margin , 5.5 cm from the green inked anterior margin , 3.5 cm from the yellow inked medial margin , and widely free of the posterior margin inked black ( approximately 4.5 cm ) and 2 cm from the skin .   
The time the specimen was placed in formalin was 9 am on May 3 , 2016 .

B )     Received in formalin labeled " Richardson , Clare Marie , B. sentinel node 2 " is a 2.0 x 2.2 x 0.5 cm aggregate of fragmented blue - dyed possible lymphoid material intermixed with yellow , lobulated adipose tissue , entirely submitted in B1 . 
C )     Received in formalin labeled " Richardson , Clare Marie , C. true superomedial margin " is a 9.9 g , 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm breast reexcision specimen previously inked red and yellow on one surface designating the true superior and medial margins .   
The opposite surface is uninked .   
It is sectioned from medial to lateral into 15 slices numbered respectively .   
The cut surface is yellow , lobulated adipose tissue with mild congestion ( 90% ) intermixed with thin white fibrous tissue ( 10% ) .
