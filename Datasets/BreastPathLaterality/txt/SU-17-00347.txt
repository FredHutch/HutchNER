Per MINDscape , deleterious BRCA1 mutation . 
MRI showed a right breast segmental non - mass enhancement ( 7.6 cm ) in the upper outer quadrant . 
GROSS DESCRIPTION : A )     Received in formalin labeled " Stahre , Grace Elaine ; R 10:30 , 3.0 cm FN mass " are five fibrofatty tissue cores ranging from 1.2 - 1.6 cm in length and up to 0.2 cm in diameter ; wrapped , inked blue , submitted entirely in A1 . 
The specimen was collected on 01/05/17 at 4:05 resulting in approximately 16 hours fixation in formalin .

ADDENDUM REASON :   Reporting results of immunohistochemistry . 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Carcinoma cells Interpreted by :   Dustin E Bosch , MD , PhD and Sania Shuja , MD , PhD Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     0 % positive cells     Allred score 0 of 8 A1     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression 
( 1 + )     Controls appropriately positive A1     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     30 % positive cells     Controls appropriately positive A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     15 % positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred score 6 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .

The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited in this report were determined by the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory at the University of Washington Medical Center , Department of Pathology , as part of an ongoing quality assurance program and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ( formerly HCFA ) as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the Immunohistochemistry Laboratory of the University of Washington Medical Center , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
Controls are appropriate for IHC stains .
