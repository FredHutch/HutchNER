-   Associated in situ component :   Not definitively identified . 
-   Angiolymphatic invasion : Not identified . -   Microcalcifications : Present in association with stroma 
. -   Additional findings :   Focal fibroadenomatoid change . 
-   Prognostic / predictive markers are reported in the table below . 
COMMENT : The needle core biopsies show nests of neoplastic cells with a prominent cribriform arrangement . 
Immunohistochemical studies for p63 and smooth muscle myosin shows loss of the myoepithelial layer around the neoplastic cells , supporting the interpretation of invasive ductal carcinoma and arguing against an in situ neoplasm . 
Dr. Rochelle Garcia and Dr. Paul Swanson have reviewed representative slides and concur with the interpretation of invasive carcinoma .

IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDIES : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Myoepithelial cells Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     P63     P 63 , ( BC4A4 )     Absent around tumor nests A1     SMHC     Smooth Muscle Myosin Heavy Chain [ SMMS-1 ]     
Absent around tumor nests Formalin - fixed , deparaffinized sections are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies . 
Localization is via an avidin biotin or streptavidin biotin immunoperoxidase method , with or without the use of heat induced epitope retrieval techniques . 
Results on the population(s ) of interest are as indicated in the table(s ) above . 
Note :   The performance characteristics of all immunohistochemical stains cited above were determined by the UW Medicine Pathology Laboratories and may include monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies whose binding is detected by avidin - biotin - peroxidase/ diaminobenzidine or Leica Bond Polymer Refine detection systems as part of ongoing quality assurance programs and in compliance with federally mandated regulations drawn from the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 ( CLIA ' 88 ) .   
Testing may have been performed at either University of Washington or Harborview Medical Centers , both labs being CLIA - certified .   
Some of these tests rely on the use of " analyte specific reagents " and are subject to specific labeling requirements by the US Food and Drug Administration .   
Such diagnostic tests may only be performed in a facility that is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a high complexity laboratory under CLIA ' 88 .   
These tests need not be cleared or approved by the FDA prior to their use .   
Nevertheless , federal rules concerning the medical use of analyte specific reagents require that the following disclaimer be attached to this report . 
This test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by the diagnostic Immunohistochemistry laboratories of the University of Washington , Department of Pathology .   
It has not been cleared or approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration . 
IHC INTERPRETATION : SMHC and p63 highlight the absence of a myoepithelial layer around the nests of neoplastic cells , supporting the interpretation of invasive carcinoma and arguing against in situ carcinoma . 
Of note , there is focal , discontinuous SMHC reactivity at the periphery of the nests of neoplastic cells that is favored to represent compressed capillaries . 
IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT : Source ( Original Label ) : A1 Population : Invasive carcinoma Block     Label     Marker For     Results     Special Pattern or Comments A1     ER     Estrogen Receptor [ SP1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     > 95% positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred Score 8 of 8 A1     Fixation time QA     Fixation time QA on predictive markers     Meets requirements A1     HER2 ( w / HIER )     HER2   ( w/ HIER ) , Quantitative Evaluation     No over - expression ( 1 + ) A1     Ki-67     Ki-67 [ MIB-1 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     < 5% positive cells A1     PR88     Progesterone Receptor [ PR88 ] , Quantitative Evaluation     > 95% positive cells     Intensity : Strong ; Allred Score 8 of 8 ER / PR and HER2 immunohistochemical analyses are performed in accordance with 2013 CAP / ASCO guidelines [ Wolff , Hammond et al ] . 
Department of Pathology protocols dictate that breast cancer containing tissue will be fixed in neutral buffered formalin for a minimum of 6 hours to a maximum of 72 hours for HER2 , ER and PR , unless otherwise noted in this report . 
ER and PR stains are interpreted using a modified H - score system ( Allred ) based on the proportion of cells staining and intensity of staining : > 1% of cells with weak staining intensity ( Allred score 3 of 8) is the clinically validated threshold for a positive result [ Harvey et al ] HER2 interpretative criteria are those recommended by CAP / ASCO , where 3 + staining ( intense , uniform , homogeneous circumferential membrane staining in > 10% of tumor cells ) is required for a positive ( " high over - expression " ) result . 
Cases with 2 + ( equivocal ) HER2 staining will be tested for gene amplification using a validated fluorescent in - situ hybridization ( FISH ) technique . 
These assays have not been validated on decalcified tissues . 
Results using decalcified tissues should be interpreted with caution , given the likelihood of false negativity in this testing environment . 
When the above stain result indicates ' Quantitative Evaluation ' , a manual morphometric scoring of the stain was performed .
