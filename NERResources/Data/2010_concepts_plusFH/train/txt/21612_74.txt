She presents for evaluation of chronic exertional dyspnea .
PFT pre - surgery on 01/25/10 did show some mild obstructive impairment ( FEV1/FVC 65% ; FEF 25 - 75% of 65% ) , and the dyspnea is worse after her lobectomy , and now she has been noticing more exertional dyspnea during her routine 2.5 mile walks . 
Her exertional dyspnea is multifactorial , due to pre - existing reactive airway disease / asthma - like condition and now even more apparent post lobectomy .
In addition , she is also noted to have an elevated left hemidiaphragm .
She is on Spiriva and prn albuterol now .
We discussed about adding Advair , but she tried that in the past and did not like it .
Because she also seems to have environmental allergies based on the history she gave us , she can try Montelukast .
Will also add Xopenex HFA .
For serology , will obtain ANA screen and IgE level today .
She is due back at the SCCA in 5 months , therefore will plan to see her back at clinic at that time , or sooner if needed .
