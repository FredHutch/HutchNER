VISIT INFORMATION : Clinic Type : SCCA Outpatient Consultation . 
Purpose of Visit : Follow - up evaluation of exertional and positional dyspnea . 
Source of Information : Patient , EHR . 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : ( adapted for previous pulmonary clinic notes ) Patient Identification : Dr Kaarsten Lang is a 53-year - old female who returns to clinic for follow up on chronic dyspnea following LUL lobectomy for stage IA non - small cell lung cancer . 
History of Present Illness Dr Lang is a 53 yr old never - smoker , diagnosed with stage IA non - small cell lung cancer s / p VATS LUL lobectomy in 01/2010 , and with a history of endometrial cancer s / p TAH / BSO in 2006 , and PMH of asthma ( airflow obstruction present prior to lobectomy ) , L hemidiaphragm elevation ( diagnosed after the LUL lobectomy ) and vocal cord dysfunction d / t left recurrent laryngeal nerve injury at the time of lobectomy , who presented to SCCA pulmonary service with dyspnea on exertion in 03/2014 . 
Workup has included evaluation for ABPA with IgE that was normal . 
Serial chest CTs obtained for cancer surveillance showed no evidence of disease and stable pulmonary nodules . 
There is notable slight elevation of her left hemidiaphragm and prior sniff test in Mt. Vernon showed some diaphragmatic paralysis . 
She has been evaluated by Dr. Merati in otolaryngology clinic with findings of mild subglottic stenosis and subtle left paresis . 
She has been treated with Xopenex and Spiriva without much noticeable improvement in DOE . 
She was given montelukast without much improvement thus she stopped . 
Ms. Lang was seen again in pulmonary clinic on 8/26/14 and given a trial of Flovent that she reports made her voice hoarse and provided minimal benefit in DOE , thus she stopped . 
She was last seen in pulmonary clinic on 10/15/14 , at which time she had full PFTs . 
She underwent a repeat sniff test on 10/15/14 that showed vigorous excursion of both hemidiaphragms and no indication of paralysis , however , there was an unexplained excessive elevation of both hemidiaphragms on shifting from the upright to the supine position . 
At that time , Dr. Lang reported no major changes in her symptoms . 
She is short of breath with exertion , even walking up a slight hill . 
Shortness of breath is worse after eating , laying flat , and laying on her left side . 
She looking to retire from orthopedic practice due to her pulmonary disability . 
Interval History : She reports having a URI with bronchitis in February , 2016 that was treated with azithromycin and a prednisone pulse starting at 60 mg and rapidly tapered with recovery to her baseline exertional and positional dyspnea . 
She has an occasional dry cough .
She endorses a 15 pound weight gain over the past year , increasing contact dermatitis that she relates to surgical scrub , bilateral hip arthralgias , and arthralgia of the base of the right thumb . 
Her surveillance chest CT scan on 9/8/2015 detected a newly enlarged solitary right axillary lymph node that was of uncertain significance and right axillary ultrasound on 1/22/16 showed the right axillary lymph node to be normal in morphology measuring 2.1 x 0.8 cm with a normal fatty hilum and thin cortex that was thought to be normal . 
No fevers , chills , night sweats , weight loss , hemoptysis . 
She does not have wheezing but reports a staggered pattern to expiration with airflow limitation in her upper mid chest and throat .

Newly enlarged solitary right axillary lymph node , uncertain significance , but unlikely to be related to either lung or endometrial cancer .
Suggest correlation for signs and symptoms of infection or inflammation in the right upper extremity . . 
Sniff test at UWMC on 10/15/15 : On deep breathing , there is vigorous excursion of both hemidiaphragms , almost 2 rib interspaces . 
There is no paradoxical motion on sniffing . 
When the patient was moved from standing to 45 degrees elevation to supine , there was substantial upward shift of the resting position of both hemidiaphragms , about 2 rib interspaces . 
Chest CT on 08/26/2014 did not show atrophy of the crus of either hemidiaphragm . 
Review of previous CT scans back to 12/16/2009 did not show any change in thickness of the crus on either side , despite left upper lobectomy . 
Conclusion : Vigorous excursion of both hemidiaphragms . 
No indication of paralysis . 
However , there is unexplained excessive elevation of both hemidiaphragms on shifting from upright to supine position .

The etiology of her dyspnea appears to be multifactorial due to obstructive airways disease related to asthma , diaphragmatic weakness and vocal cord dysfunction . 
Her diaphragmatic weakness results in cephalad displacement of the diaphragm when the patient is in a supine position as documented during fluoroscopy , although interestingly , there is no significant change in her slow vital capacity in the supine compared to upright position on the lung volumes measured on 10/15/14 . 
Her PFTs performed today show a stable mild obstructive pattern and mild diffusing capacity abnormality that are not significantly changed since the study on 10/15/14 .
The cause of her diaphragmatic weakness remains unexplained . 
Her case has been reviewed with Dr. Josh Benditt who specializes in neuromuscular lung disease , however , he is unable to explain these findings or recommend additional testing or treatment for her condition . 
We discussed the option of surgical plication of the left hemidiaphragm , however , the patient is reluctant to consider this surgical procedure at this time . 
In addition , she has discussed treatment options for her vocal cord dysfunction including injection laryngoplasty , however , given concern for possible increased upper airway obstruction by the injected vocal cord this option has been deferred . 
I recommend continuing bronchodilator therapy with Spiriva and Xopenex inhalers and monitor for progression of the exertional dyspnea at which time surgical plication of the left hemidiaphragm can reconsidered if no other cause is uncovered . 
The patient is in the process of submitting a disability claim for her exertional dyspnea that prevents her from performing her job as an orthopedic surgeon . 
She has given us claim forms for two insurance companies , UNUM and Sun Life Insurance Company of Canada . 
Since I am only covering Dr. Cheng who has seen the patient on multiple occasions but is out of town today , I will turn these claim forms over to her for completion . 
The patient understands this plan and agrees . 
There is no need for her to reschedule an appointment with the pulmonary clinic at this time , however , we are happy to see her again should the need arise . 
PLAN : 1 .
Continue bronchodilator therapy with Spiriva and Xopenex inhalers 2 .
Return to SCCA pulmonary medicine clinic prn . 
3 .
Additional monitoring of the right axillary lymph node will be performed by Dr. Lee and the SCCA lung oncology team .
