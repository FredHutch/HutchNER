( cross reference image 122 series 4 , with image 197 series 601 ) .
No other emboli are seen . Right adrenal mass measures 3.8 x 2.0 cm , unchanged from 12/8/10 . 
Prominent mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes . 
Emphysema and scarring in both lungs with a few ectatic bronchi . 
Status post right upper lobectomy , as before . ASSESSMENT AND PLAN : Mr. Abston is a 68 year old gentleman with NSCLC admitted to the heme / onc service on 1/19/10 with hypoxia , dyspnea , cough , low grade fevers , found to have partially occlusive PE . 
# Hypoxia , dyspnea , fevers : clinical picture is unclear due to poor history of how the symptoms began .
Differential is broad including infectious ( CAP ) vs. vascular ( PE ) vs. cardiac ( arrythmia , heart failure , volume overload ) .
Even in light of a likely explanation for his hypoxia , his newly found PE , will still consider infectious as a likely possibility given his clinical syndrome of fevers , hypoxia , dyspnea on exertion and cough even though his CT does not show a consolidation .
He has been living in the community and is at potential risk for community acquired pneumonia especially in the setting of his recent chemotherapy . 
-Heparin drip for PE -- anticipate transitioning to lovenox bridge and coumadin in the next day or two -Ceftriaxone and azithromycin for CAP coverage -Will monitor fever curve closely -Blood and urine cultures -Nasal swab for respiratory viruses PCR # Arthritis : Currently using oxycodone at home for management of neck , shoulder , back pain -Oxycodone 5 - 10 mg PO Q6 hours PRN -Docusate , senna # NSCLC : currently awaiting initiation of his fourth round of chemotherapy for his stage IIIA disease now s / p RUL , LLL resection .
Last received pemetrexed on 1/4/11 -F / U with Dr. Martins on discharge # FEN : -Regular diet -No need for IV fluids at this time -Monitoring and repleting electrolytes PRN # Prophylaxis : -DVT : heparin gtt -GI : bowel regimen # Dispo : likely return home to friend 's house in Ballard once improving # Code Status : FULL # Family Contacts : daughters # SCCA : Renato Martins , MD Margaret Roller , MD R1 Pager : 416 - 0454 ATTENDING STATEMENT : I saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Roller 's note . 
This is a 68 year old man with NSCLC and s / p RUL resection now with worsening shortness of breath and found to have PE on CT imaging . 
Started on heparin gtt and assessing O2 requirement . 
Also productive cough . 
Given poor functional reserve with treat for chronic bronchitis with antibacterials and check NP swab for respiratory viruses .
