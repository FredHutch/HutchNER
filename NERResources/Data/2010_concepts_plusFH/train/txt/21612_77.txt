SCCA PULMONARY MEDICINE : FOLLOW - UP NOTE ID : 53 yr old never - smoker , diagnosed with stage 1a lung cancer s / p LUL lobectomy in 01/2010 , and with a history of endometrial cancer s / p TAH / BSO in 2006 , and PMH of asthma ( diagnosed after the LUL lobectomy ) and L hemi - diaphragm elevation ( also diagnosed after the LUL lobectomy ) , who presented to SCCA pulmonary with dyspnea on exertion in 03/2014 and was worked up for ABPA ( which was negative ) and was given a prescription for montelukast .
She presents in follow - up today because of persistent dyspnea on exertion . 
Interval History : Dr. Lang reports that she is short of breath for some part of every day .
Her dyspnea is exacerbated with exertion ( even walking on a slight hill ) and she is unable to keep up with her 14 yr old daughter on walks .
She does go on 2.5 - 3 mile walks 2 - 3 times per week , but feels her lifestyle is limited by the dyspnea .
The dyspnea is also positional , worsening when she leans back , lays flat or lays on her left side .
She feels like she is suffocating when she lays on her left side .
She does not specifically notice dyspnea when bending down to put on her shoes .
She also notes SOB when she eats a lot ( the theory is that her full stomach is causing even more upward deflection of the L diaphragm ) .
Dr. Lang also reports an occasional cough , which is dry .
She has never had hemoptysis .
She denies fevers , chills , night sweats and weight loss .
She has only minimal LE edema after standing in OR cases all day . 
In June 2014 , she had an episode of SVT requiring an ER visit .
She was given IV B - blockers and was told to decrease her Synthroid dose ( which she did ) and to increase her PO metoprolol dose .
She was concerned about her borderline low BP and she did not want to increase the metoprolol ( she continues on 25 mg daily at this time ) .
When she had the SVT , she was very short of breath and lightheaded .
She does not note tachycardia on a daily basis when her symptoms are present .
She denies chest pain , lightheadedness , and exertional syncope .
She is supposed to have a month - long holter monitor because of the ER visit , but wanted to wait until after summer to do that test .
She did have a stress test and an echo after the ER visit , both of which she reports were normal . 
For her asthma , she reports that triggers are dust , pollen , and smoke .
She continues to use Spiriva daily , but discontinued Advair in the past because it caused terrible thrush and made her voice hoarse .
She was started on montelukast in 03/2014 , which she took until the prescription ran out , but she stopped it because she felt it did not change her symtpoms .
Additionally , albuterol was changed to Xopenex due to some tachyarrhythmias .
She has not used albuterol or Xopenex in months ; she does not carry it with her and she does not feel like it helps her symptoms when she uses it anyway .

Her dyspnea sounds multifactorial : the positional dyspnea could be related to diaphragm weakness or paralysis ; the exertional dyspnea could be due to the diaphragm weakness or asthma / airflow obstruction .
It is unlikely to be cardiac in origin given her normal TTE and stress test earlier this year .
The recent episode of SVT raises suspicion that the exertional dyspnea could be associated with a tachyarrythmia , but she denies feeling very tachycardic at those times .
She plans to do the holter monitor testing in the near future . 
RECOMMENDATIONS : - continue Spiriva daily and Xopenex PRN - add Flovent 110mcg 2sp Q12hr , which will hopefully not cause thrush in the HFA delivery system ( instead of powder from the discus ) - check PFTs with supine vital capacity , and MIP / MEP , along with lung volumes and DLCO - check sniff test to evaluate whether L hemidiaphragm is paralyzed - no further follow - up for stable pulmonary nodules ; will defer lung cancer surveillence to oncology - encouraged to get the holter monitoring to evaluate for tachyarrhythmias Return to clinic in 6 - 8 weeks to review the results of the testing and assess dyspnea with the addition of Flovent Seen and discussed with Dr. Cheng . 
ATTENDING STATEMENT : I saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Ramos ' note .
Very pleasant 53 yo physician with h / o of LUL lobectomy for stage I lung ca and endometrial cancer s / p surgery with persistent intermittent dyspnea after her lobectomy for which we have seen her previously .
Likely that there is a component of neuromuscular weakness given her left hemidiaphragm elevation and positional aspect of her dyspnea , as well as pre - existing inflammatory airways disease / asthma .
Cardiac origin possible given her recent SVT episode , although unlikely that this is a major contributor .
Although patient does not want to have an aggressive surgical intervention for diaphragmatic paralysis if this is the case , she would like to have a firm diagnosis .
To that end , we will pursue PFTs with MIP / MEP as well as a sniff test to assess for the diaphragmatic paralysis .
Additionally we recommend another trial of inhaled corticosteroids for small airways disease .
She will f / u in several weeks after these tests are conducted .
