SCCA PULMONARY MEDICINE : FOLLOW - UP NOTE ID 53-year - old woman returns to clinic for follow up on chronic dyspnea following LUL lobectomy . 
History of Present Illness 53 yr old never - smoker , diagnosed with stage 1a lung cancer s / p LUL lobectomy in 01/2010 , and with a history of endometrial cancer s / p TAH / BSO in 2006 , and PMH of asthma ( airflow obstruction present prior to lobectomy ) and L hemidiaphragm elevation ( diagnosed after the LUL lobectomy ) , who presented to SCCA pulmonary with dyspnea on exertion in 03/2014 . 
Workup has included workup for ABPA with IgE that was normal . 
CTs obtained for cancer with no evidence of disease and stable pulmonary nodules . 
There is notable slight elevation of her left hemidiaphragm and prior sniff test in Mt. Vernon showed some diaphragmatic paralysis . 
She has been evaluated by Dr. Merati in Oto clinic with finding of mild subglottic stenosis and essentially normal vocal cord function ( subtle left paresis ) . 
She has been treated with Xopenex and Spiriva without much noticeable improvement . 
She was given montelukast without much improvement thus she stopped . 
Ms. Lang was last seen in pulmonary clinic on 8/26/14 and given a trial of Flovent .
She reports that this made her voice hoarse and provided minimal benefit , thus she stopped . 
She had full PFTs today and will be going to UWMC following clinic visit today for Sniff test . 
Ms. Lang reports no major changes in her symptoms . 
She is short of breath with exertion , even walking up a slight hill . 
Shortness of breath is worse after eating , laying flat , and laying on her left side . 
She has stopped taking call in her orthopedic practice and is no longer doing large joint surgeries . 
She has an occasional dry cough . 
No fevers , chills , night sweats , weight loss , hemoptysis . 
She does not have wheezing but reports a staggered pattern to expiration with airflow limitation in her upper mid chest . 
She runs out of air when speaking . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Past Medical History Endometrial cancer s / p TAH / BSO in 2006 .

She is seen in follow up for continued dyspnea . 
Etiology is not entirely clear but likely multifactorial . 
Her PFTs are prolonged expiration are consistent with airflow obstruction ; however , she does not respond to bronchodilators symptomatically or on PFTs . 
She is continued on Spiriva and Xopenex . 
She did not like Flovent .
Workup for ABPA was negative . 
Her dyspnea is likely due in large part to her diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis , possibly from phrenic nerve injury during lobectomy . 
She had a prior sniff test outside that showed limited movement of the diaphragm ( details unclear ) . 
Her left diaphragm appears mildly elevated on prior imaging ( including CT scout when lying flat ) . 
Her MEP is reduced on PFTs today . 
She has a repeat Sniff test planned for this afternoon at UW which will help clarify the degree and type of dysfunction . 
We discussed the possibility of diaphragmatic plication but she is reluctant to undergo general anesthesia due to the neurologic deficits she had following prior surgery . 
It is not clear if she would be a candidate for an alternative therapy such as a diaphragmatic pacer . 
RECOMMENDATIONS : - continue Spiriva daily and Xopenex PRN - CBC to evaluate DLCO correction - f / u Sniff test today - Will consider further therapy for diaphragm weakness after sniff test and how she feels clinically - no further follow - up for stable pulmonary nodules ; will defer lung cancer surveillance to oncology Return to clinic in ~2 months to see how she is progressing and discuss treatment options for diaphragm . 
Seen and discussed with Dr. Cheng . 
ATTENDING STATEMENT : I saw and evaluated the patient and agree with Dr. Mann 's note -- Dr Lang returns for f / u for persistent dyspnea .
She tried the inhaled corticosteroid and stopped it due to hoarseness .
PFTs reveal an obstructive pattern which was seen previously in 2010 likely due to small airways disease , and a mild DLCO abnormality previously seen .
There is a mild decline in MEP , suggesting some component of expiratory respiratory muscle weakness , however VC did not change in the supine position , and her SNIFF test ( which was performed after the clinic visit and Dr Mann 's documentation above ) was essentially normal , although it was noted that she had elevation of her diaphragms while changing from upright to supine position , which is when she is symptomatic .
Additionally , inspiratory limb of FVL is slightly flattened ( although not markedly so ) , suggesting perhaps there is a a functional upper airway obstruction ie vocal cord dysfunction .
She saw the ENT specialist a few years ago and had a DL which did demonstrate a subtle left VC paresis and mild subglottic stenosis .
The sudden diaphragmatic elevation is unexplained , however together these data together suggests to me that her persistent chronic dyspnea is most likely due to an functional upper airway problem , ie VCD , against the backdrop of chronic asthma .
I discussed this over the phone with her after her sniff test , stating that I would discuss her case with Dr Benditt who specializes in neuromuscular lung disease , and suggesting that she might want to be re - evaluated by Dr Merati of ENT for upper airway obstruction .
She is considering these options , as her dyspnea has impacted her ability to work at full capacity as a surgeon as well as her daily level of activity . 
Time spent on patient visit : 40 minutes including 25 minutes in direct interaction which involved counseling and coordination of care .
