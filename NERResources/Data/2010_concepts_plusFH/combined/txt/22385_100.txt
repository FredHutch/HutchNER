ID : 56 yo man with B3 HIV and CAD s / p MI , T4N2M0 non small cell CA s / p paclitaxel / rad comes for f / u after restarting HAART CONTACT INFO : 206 - 370 - 4305 ( cell phone , can leave messages ) Interval history : History obtained via phone interpreter . 
Shun reports that he restarted his ART after his last visit , approximately one month ago . 
He denies any side effects of the medication , and he states that he has not missed a dose . 
Review of his medication pick - up with pharmacy does however show that he should have run out of meds / picked up one week ago , which is concerning for non - compliance . 
It is possible that he took some of the meds that were left over from when he stopped during chemo . 
The importance of 100% compliance was again stressed to him , especially given that he has already acquired resistant virus . 
He is otherwise feeling better compared to last visit . 
His appetite has improved and he has gained some weight . 
His energy is improved . 
He does continue to have a cough productive of white phlegm , which is stable and which he has had since his diagnosis . 
He denies hemoptysis . 
He denies chest pain . 
He is SOB with climbing stairs to his 3rd floor apartment , but this is also stable for him . 
He denies any fevers , chills , sweats . 
He has not had any symptoms consistent with angina .

6/11 : CT chest ( personally reviewed ) : Impression : 1 . 
Substantial interval decrease in the size of dominant right central lung mass with a 1.2 x 1.1 cm residual component . 2 . 
New , moderate right - sided hydropneumothorax . Assess / Plan : 1 . 
B3 HIV - He has restarted prior regimen of atazanavir / ritonavir / truvada / raltegravir , given his prior history of acquiring M184V mutation . 
He states that he has excellent adherence but he is not picking up his meds on time . 
Will continue to follow his labs closely ( HIV VL ) as well as his pharmacy pickups . 
He is very high risk for not taking meds as directed and acquiring additional resistance mutations . 
His CD4 count is dropping and he urgently needs to stay on HAART - he understands this in theory . 
-Await HIV VL -Continue current regimen ( atazanavir / ritonavir , truvada , raltegravir ) -Continue dapsone prophylaxis , no need for MAC prophylaxis at this time . 
-Continue to monitor viral load q4 - 6 weeks until undetectable . 2 . 
Nonsmall cell CA , likely lung primary , now with R sided hydropneumothorax - Appreciate excellent care by oncology and radiation oncology . 
He appears to be asymptomatic from hydropneuothorax , without worsening SOB / chest pain . 
However , size of hydrothorax is concerning . 
He is scheduled to see pulmonary next week for f / u - will touch base with them to see if he would benefit from more urgent eval . 
-F / u pulmonary 6/25 , if not sooner -f / u Dr. Easton next month -Good response of mass to chemo / xrt , substantially smaller , further plans as per Dr. Easton 3 . 
NSTEMI 12/08 , s / p stent - Patient followed by cards -BP stable and well controlled on metoprolol -Continue to hold lisinopril for now -No symptoms of angina -ASA 81 mg daily -F / U Jan 2013 4 . 
Hyperlipidemia - On rosavastatin and slo - niacin . 
-Lipids with excellent control .
( 12/2011 ) 5 . 
Tobacco use - Does not want to pursue smoking cessation 6 . 
Tubular adenoma - colonoscopy - Will need repeat colonoscopy in 2012 per GI - will reassess need for this in near future based on overall response to chemo / prognosis for non - small cell CA 7 . 
Social - Patient brings disability paperwork for completion . 
He is extremely fatigued and would not be able to sustain employment . 
His T4N2M0 nonsmall cell CA / recent chemo for this , as well as his advanced HIV infection would be expected to cause fatigue which would make employment untenable .
