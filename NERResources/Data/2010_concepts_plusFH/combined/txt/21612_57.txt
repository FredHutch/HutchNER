SCCA PULMONARY CONSULT NOTE We were asked to see this patient by Dr. Eaton of the oncology service for evaluation of shortness of breath . 
Identifying Data Dr. Lang is a 49yo F with a resected stage IA adenocarcinoma of the lung who presents with persistent dyspnea on exertion . 
Chief Concern ( Required for all billing levels ) shortness of breath History of Present Illness ( When indicated , an extended HPI required at least 4 of location , quality , severity , duration , timing , content , modifying factors , associated symptoms / signs ) Dr. Lang is a 49-year - old woman who had a stage 1A adenocarcinoma of the lung , s / p LUL resection on 1/26/10 , who presents to pulmonary clinic with persistent but episodic shortness of breath now 5 months following her surgery . 
She has not had adjuvant chemotherapy . 
She states that she has had significant shortness of breath , especially with exertion since her surgery . 
It is episodic with some weeks being better than others . 
She has some days where she has to sit while talking to her patients because she feels breathless even with standing . 
She has not noticed any triggers for her shortness of breath including hay fever or allergy symptoms . 
She does not have a history of childhood asthma but does have hay fever that has been long standing .
She does not have reflux symptoms or symptoms of post - nasal drip . 
Since her surgery , she has also had shortness of breath with lying flat and sleeps with 3 - 4 pillows and the shortness of breath comes on immediately . 
Notably , she also had unilateral vocal cord paralysis following surgery which has been improving in terms of her hoarseness considerably over time .

The flow volume loop does suggest pulmonary airflow obstruction and is not the pattern of upper airway airflow obstruction for instance caused by vocal cord paralysis . 
She has noted some relief since starting advair and it is likely that her shortness of breath is contributed to by reactive airways disease . 
There does not appear to be a contribution of GERD or PND to her symptoms . 
The history of being short of breath upon lying flat raises the possibility of unilateral diaphragm paralysis which could also contribute to her symptoms . 
Reactive Airways disease : - increase advair to 500/50 - restart albuterol prn Possible unilateral diaphragm paralysis : - sniff test under flouroscopy We will follow up the results of the sniff test which the patient will have at skagit valley after they are sent to us here and will check in regarding her symptoms then by phone . 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this patient 's care . 
Please call with any questions . 
ATTENDING STATEMENT : I saw and evaluated the patient .
I have visualized the serial CXRs , PET / CT scan performed 1/25/10 and the chest CT scan performed 2/11/10 . 
I agree with the assessment and recommendations outlined in Dr. Mikacenic 's note which were jointly formulated by Dr. Mikacenic and me . 
The patient has moderate airflow obstruction on spirometry that is new and only modestly improved with albuterol MDI .
She has normal lung volumes ( sitting upright in the body box ) and a mild diffusing capacity abnormality that is unchanged from the preop study after correction for alveolar volume . 
Her CXR on 5/24/10 shows a persistently elevated left hemidiaphragm suggestive of possible left phrenic nerve paralysis .
Since the lung volumes are measured in the upright position any physiological consequence of left diaphragm paralysis would be minimized .
Repeating the vital capacity in the supine and then upright position could unmask the effect of the diaphragmatic paralysis .
Alternatively hemidiaphragm paralysis can be diagnosed by the sniff test under fluoroscopy . 
I suspect that she has dyspnea due to new onset airflow obstruction from reactive airways disease and the dyspnea may be amplified if her left hemidiaphragm is nonfunctional .
Although she has vocal cord paralysis we do not see a flattening of the flow volume loop to suggest that this is the cause of her dyspnea . 
We have increased her Advair dose and recommended to her that she use the albuterol for rescue .
We have also ordered a sniff test that will be performed at Skagit Valley Medical Center with the images and results sent to us . 
We will contact her once this study is completed and follow up on her symptoms since increasing the dose of Advair .
