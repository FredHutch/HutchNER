He is known to us , initiallly seen on 01/04/12 at our Lung Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Clinic for hemoptysis and right hilar / lung mass .
EBUS - TBNA was performed on 01/09/12 , nodal stations 7 and 4R were positive for malignancy , suggestive of non - small cell lung cancer .

The right central mass has decreased in size , now measuring 1.2 x 1.1 cm .
There is a small 8 mm lymph node ( 4/81 ) , and persistent subtle right bronchus intermedius posterior wall thickening .
There were no nodules or masses to indicate metastasis .
Repeat CXR today showed persistent right apical pneumothorax with 3 cm of apical pleural separation .
There is RLL atelectasis .
His left lung is otherwise clear . 
Mr. Deng is accompanied by an interpreter at clinic today .
He reports that overall feeling fairly well from a pulmonary standpoint .
He endorses cough , which he has had at least since January 2012 .
He no longer has hemoptysis since he completed chemoradiation in April .

Assessment Mr. Deng presents to our outpatient SCCA pulmonary clinic for evaluation of hydropneumothorax , which was noted on chest CT dated 06/11/12 .
He was initiallly seen at our Lung Cancer Early Detection and Prevention Clinic on 01/04/12 for hemoptysis and right hilar / lung mass .
EBUS - TBNA was performed on 01/09/12 , nodal stations 7 and 4R were positive for malignancy / non - small cell lung cancer .
Surgery was not an option due to the location of the lesion and localized metastases , therefore he was referred to the SCCA lung oncology clinic .
He completed chemoradiation with paclitaxel in April 2012 .
He is afebrile at clinic , with SaO2 95% R / A. Noted diminished breath sounds R lung . 
Right - sided hydropneumothorax : This was an incidental finding on chest CT 06/11/12 .
This is likely a spontaneous process , due to his underlying emphysema .
Appears to be persistent or somewhat larger based on today 's CXR .
Although patient is asymptomatic at this time , we are concerned about the current size of his pneumothorax which is not getting smaller .
Therefore , we recommend admitting Mr. Deng to UWMC inpatient heme / onc service .
Since there are no beds available today , he will most likely be admitted tomorrow .
A radiology requisition has been prepared for the insertion of a pigtail chest tube which will take place in IR .
We have discussed the plan with Mr. Deng , and he has agreed with the plan we proposed . 
Due to language barrier , he provided us with his daughter 's contact information in preparation for admission tomorrow .
His daughter Cody ( may not be the right spelling ) can be reached at 206 - 331 - 9544 .
Mr. Deng 's cell phone is 206 - 370 - 4305 .
Thank you for allowing us to participate in his care .
Please call with any questions . 
Plan 1 .
Pigtail chest tube insertion at UWMC IR .
Radiology requisition has been submitted to RN Karen at the SCCA . 2 .
Elective admission to UWMC tomorrow .
Patient / daughter will be contacted further with admission instructions .

spontaneous hydropneumothorax detected on surveillance chest CT scan of 6/11/12 . 
I agree with the history , findings , assessment and recommendations which were jointly formulated by Ms. Rahardja and me and outlined above in her note .
A focused exam on the respiratory system revealed decreased breath sounds on the right side without rales , ronchi or expiratory wheezes .
The patient had normal diaphragmatic excursion , and no tenderness or chest wall deformities . 
I have personally visualized the chest CT scan dated 6/11/12 and the CXR performed today .
He has a moderate size right hydropneumothorax that is either unchanged or slightly larger on todays CXR compared to the scout film on the 6/11/12/ chest CT scan although this is not an exact comparison . 
Based upon my evaluation of the clinical history , physical examination , laboratory and radiographic results , my assessment and recommendations for the patient 's main medical issues are as follows : 1 .
Hydropneumothorax : spontaneous , asymptomatic and without impairment of his vital signs or resting RA O2 sat . 
The most likely etiology is rupture of an emphysematous bleb as there is no history of trauma and no recent invasive procedures .
Given that the hydropneumothorax has not decreased in size over a period of 1 week , it is necessary to insert a pigtail pleural catheter to re - expand the right lung and drain the pleural fluid .
Since the pleural catheter will need to be connected to suction and will required staged management to assure complete resolution of the pleural defect , he will need to be hospitalized . 
We explained the situation to the patient through the help of an Mandarin interpreter .
He is agreeable to this plan as is Dr. Paul Hendrie , inpatient Heme - Onc director . 
Due to the lack of inpatient beds and because he is not clinically unstable , we have elected to have him admitted tomorrow to the resident Heme - Onc service after insertion of the pleural catheter by interventional radiology . 
Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the care of your patient .
Please feel free to contact me at 206 - 667 - 4589 if you have any questions or concerns I spent 60 minutes in the evaluation and coordination of care of this patient including 35 minutes of direct interaction with the patient and excluding time spent teaching .
