Laboratory Results ( Last result for the prior 7 days ) 09/08/2015 Na 137 K 3.9 Cl 103 CO2 27 Glucose Level 92 BUN 12 Creatinine 0.73 Ca 9.3 LD ( Total ) 172 AST ( GOT ) 12 ALT ( GPT ) 12 Alk Phos ( Total ) 45 Bilirubin ( Total ) 0.4 Bilirubin ( Direct ) 0.1 Protein ( Total ) 7.2 Albumin 4.3 WBC 5.65 RBC 4.52 Hb 14.1 HCT 41 PLT 232 Neutrophils 2.82 RADIOLOGY CT CAP , 9/8/15 .
I personally reviewed these images and discussed this scan with the attending radiologist , Dr. O'Malley . 
IMPRESSION : 1 . 
History of lung and endometrial cancer with no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease . 2 . 
Newly enlarged solitary right axillary lymph node , uncertain significance , but unlikely to be related to either lung or endometrial cancer .
Suggest correlation for signs and symptoms of infection or inflammation in the right upper extremity . 
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN Dr. Lang is a 54-year - old woman , never smoker , with stage IA non - small cell lung cancer , EGFR negative , now greater than 5.5 years status post lobectomy .
Her CT scan was intended to be her final routine surveillance imaging , however it now shows an enlarged right axillary node .
The location does not raise concern for recurrent lung cancer , however since this is new , we will plan to follow up in 3 - 4 months with a right axillary ultrasound .
She prefers to wait 4 months .
In the interim , she understands to notify us if she develops any new symptoms or problems , pain , new palpable lumps . 
She continues with exertional SOB .
She recalls last time she met with Dr. Cheng in Pulmonary she was told that Dr. Cheng would inquire with Dr. Plender a neuro - pulmonary specialist who may have input into her hemidiaphragm paralysis , but she never heard back .
My last note mentions a referral to Dr. Benditt .
She is interested in follow up with Dr. Cheng and I will facilitate . 
Follow up in 4 months with axillary ultrasound .
