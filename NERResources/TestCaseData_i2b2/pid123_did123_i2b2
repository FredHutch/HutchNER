this is a fake test doc .
the patient was given mad tylenol today , lol .
pt presented with severe lacerations induced by a confrontation with an angry honey badger .
A biopsy was performed on the pt's liver just for kicks , and Dr. Ernesto invited his pet ostrich
to oversee the procedure . Afterwards , the pt had to be tested for a number of animal diseases .
All in all , I'd say it was a good day to practice medicine .
