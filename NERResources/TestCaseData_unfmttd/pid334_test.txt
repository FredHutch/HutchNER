PATIENT IDENTIFICATION AND CHIEF COMPLAINT
Ms Hansen is a 73-year-old woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, which she has been dealing with for almost 5 years.  She presents today for discussion of potential palliative radiation to painful left occipital metastases at the request of Dr. Renato Martins in Medical Oncology.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS
Ms Hansen was originally diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in 2008, at which time she was undergoing evaluation and treatment for right upper lobe mass and had neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by 45 Gy of radiation.  Ultimately, she went to surgery; however, at the time of thoracotomy, she was noted to have pleural implants, and procedure was aborted.  She was then initiated on palliative systemic therapy, mostly receiving erlotinib since 2008.  This was briefly switched; however, when switched to Taxol she experienced significant peripheral neuropathy, and, thus, was restarted back on erlotinib.

In May 2012, she had a PET scan, which demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the right upper lung nodule.  Also noted were multiple new axial skeletal mets, as well as a left parietal/occipital junction lytic lesion in the skull.  Adjacent to this, just superior, was also another tiny lytic lesion in the left parietal bone.

She continued on palliative erlotinib and had restaging scans with a PET scan in September 2012, demonstrating interval response to therapy. Over the past several months, Ms. Hansen has been noting increasing pain and discomfort in her left occiput.  She states that this has been notable for such that at times she felt that she could feel a palpable soft tissue nodule that seemed to be increasing and decreasing depending on the therapy that she was on.  She is having an uncomfortable time when she lies supine, resting the posterior part of her head on a pillow and, thus, primarily leans on the side.  She denies any frank headaches.  She states that she is having nonspecific tenderness, and what she describes as a deep ache in the area of the left parietal occipital soft tissue lesion.  She denies any change to vision.  Hearing has been stable, and she does have a history of Meniere disease but states that she has not had any exacerbations of this.  Denies any visual changes for quite some time, but now she has experienced intermittent what she describes as ""floaters.""  There have been no seizures, no nausea or vomiting, though she did have an episode of emesis, which she relates was directly related to her chemotherapy.  Her peripheral neuropathy is slowly improving but not resolved.  Overall, she notes no frank difficulty with balance and no loss of consciousness.

SOCIAL HISTORY
Ms. Hansen is accompanied today by her husband.  She has a new granddaughter, which she is very excited about.  She is a nondrinker.  The patient was a previous smoker but quit in the distant past.

FAMILY HISTORY
Negative for cancer.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS
A 14-point review of systems is completed with positives mentioned as per HPI.  Otherwise, negative.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
VITAL SIGNS:  Weight is 123.7 pounds (56.0 kg), blood pressure 167/105, pulse is 113, oxygen saturation 100% on room air, temperature is 36.2 degrees Celsius.
GENERAL:  This is an age-appropriate appearing Caucasian female, who is awake, alert and oriented times 3.
HEENT :  Head is atraumatic.  The patient is alopecic but with hair that is growing back.  Over the left parietal occipital junction, there is a small area where the patient is able to localize where she is tender to gentle palpation.  There is very minimal asymmetry noted with underlying soft tissue nodule appreciated that is not appreciated on the right.  Otherwise, palpation of the rest of the scalp does not cause any tenderness.  Sclerae are anicteric with extraocular movements intact.  Nose is normal.  Oral mucosa is moist without any abnormality.
NECK:  Supple with no palpable cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
HEART:  Mildly tachycardic but no appreciable murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
ABDOMEN:  Soft, nontender.
SKIN:  Warm, dry.  No rashes.
NEUROLOGIC:  Cranial nerve examination II-XII within normal limits.  Gait is normal.  Speech is normal.

IMAGING
Ms Hansen has had several CT scans, however, no recent MRI.  The most recent CT scan of the head, which was performed on January 4, 2012, demonstrates a lytic lesion within the left posterior parietal skull with increased bony erosion and breakthrough of the inner and outer table.  There was also noted to be increased size of an adjacent soft tissue mass within the scalp.  This is a noncontrast scan, and given the patient's history of renal insufficiency, epidural extension and intracranial extension cannot be evaluated without contrast.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN
Ms Hansen is a 73-year-old female with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, now with painful left occipital metastases, which has demonstrated interval growth over the past several months, correlating with increased pain and discomfort in this area.  She is here today for discussion of possible palliative radiation to this area.

We had a discussion with Ms Hansen.  She understands that she has not had a recent MRI, and while we would plan on doing this without contrast, an MRI would be helpful to better delineate soft tissue extent as well as intracranial extension that was not well-visualized on her most recent noncontrast CT scan.  We have discussed that this would be beneficial with regards to potential treatment volume, and she has agreed to proceed on with this therapy, and we have established this for tomorrow morning.

We had a discussion with regards to the palliative nature of radiation therapy.  She understands that this is not a curative approach, and the goal would be to improve quality of life and hopefully improve the pain and discomfort and further growth of the lesion in the left occiput.  She also does note that in the past she has noted some occasional aches and pains with regards to her vertebral bodies, as she was noted to have vertebral uptake in several vertebral bodies on her PET scan, correlating with areas of metastatic disease.  We discussed that these could potentially be addressed with palliative radiation therapy; however, she is more inclined to watch it at this time, and in the future potentially discuss radiation therapy to these sites in the event that she has symptomatic progression with regard to poorly controlled pain.  She is not currently taking any pain medications.  When she does have discomfort, she does take an aspirin and notes that she does have improvement with this.  Obviously, with regard to the brain, there is a concern for further progression intracranially, which could potentially cause symptomatic manifestation, and she does wish to proceed on with palliative radiation to this area at this time.

Pending the outcome of tomorrow's MRI scan, if numerous lesions are seen in the intracranial contents, we did discuss potential therapy would be whole brain as consideration.  We discussed in the absence intraparenchymal metastatic disease within the brain, we could consider localized radiation to the parietal/occipital lesion.  Given that this is in close proximity to the brain, we would favor an approach that is fractionated over the course of 10 treatments.  We discussed potential side effects associated with radiation therapy with Ms Hansen today and discussed that these could potentially include fatigue, skin reaction, alopecia, tenderness, potential for swelling, which could cause headache, nausea, and vomiting.  We also discussed the potential long-term side effects associated with radiation therapy in close proximity or including the brain could include changes in neurocognition and potential damage to normal brain tissue.  We also discussed the potential for secondary malignancy.

After having the above discussion, Ms Hansen does agree to proceed on with the above-mentioned MRI tomorrow with plans for CT simulation in our department in the afternoon.  She does state that she has significant anxiety surrounding the process of mask-fitting, and we have given her a prescription for Ativan today to take prior to her CT simulation in addition to prior to her radiation treatments.  Ms Hansen had several questions that were answered, and her husband had no further questions with regard to the plan going forward and the potential side effects.  She did sign consent form today to proceed on with therapy.

Thank you very much for allowing us to participate in the care of Ms Hansen.

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN STATEMENT
