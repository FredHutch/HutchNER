300PtsWithDxInfo.csv -
    - Stands for "300 patients with diagnosis info".
    - This is the output of a caisis query to collect our patient-level "gold" standard
    - Used as input into Emily's UW database script which pulls out all the docs associated with these MRNs

will_dev_notes.txt -
    - The output of Emily's UW DB query
    - Contains tons of notes, not necessarily the ones with dx info in them; we need to filter them
    - Serves as input into txt2tsv.py script

dx_docs_no_filter -
    - The output from txt2tsv.py.
    - Still lots of notes that we need to filter through to find the ones we want to annotate. Technically this level
        is our full data set (training or test or whatever) since the filtering we do pre-annotation skews
        the actual distribution of TPs
    - Serves as input to filter_by_timediff.py:
        - This script filters out all the docs that should contain a diagnosis date.
        - Result of this script is a tsv with only docs we want to put though Labkey for annotation

Data/dx_docs_filtered.tsv -
    - These are the subset of the dataset that need to receive annotations. Read them into labkey, record what your
        jobrunid is, and use that as an identifyer in your labkey.ini configuration file
